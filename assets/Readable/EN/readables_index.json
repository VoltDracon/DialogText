Since records began, there has never been an age as enlightened and reasoned as this.\n\nEven on moonless nights, the countless towering monoliths of the metropolis are illuminated by innumerable lights. The metal pipes that connect the streets and districts shine with a resplendent glow, the golden liquid flowing within imbuing the city with a vital energy.\n\nThat aureate fluid is \"lithin,\" the lifeblood of human civilization. Since The Technocracy first discovered it 100 years ago, it has been the source of countless innovations, leading humanity into a new era. Automated tilling machines revolutionized farming, more than sextupling agricultural yields, while airborne shuttles soared into the sky, connecting the once-isolated cities dotting the continent.\n\nThe people of today can no longer imagine a world without lithin. This applies doubly so for the rulers of the now interconnected cities.\n\nLithin was first discovered in the ruins of the ancient settlement known as Natlantea, a city located deep within the earth, thus allowing for the mining of the substance, whose roots lie deeper still.\n\nAs there was no way to drill so deep from the surface, lithin production was concentrated in the hands of those who controlled the Natlantean ruins — the Technocratic Assembly. As demand for lithin grew, conflicts arose between the cities over its supply and distribution. As disputes became ever more common — and increasingly bitter — the specter of war grew ever darker, enveloping the land.\n\nThough, at least for today, the residents of the metropolis have temporarily forgotten the shadow that hangs over them, as they crowd the streets and plazas for the \"Continental Fair\" being held in their city.\n\nThis grand event, organized by the Technocratic Assembly, is a celebration of peace and progress, showcasing the latest inventions and fruits of technological innovation. Even though these inventions will likely soon contribute to the growing arms race between the disparate cities, they still serve as temporary comfort to an anxious populace.\n\nThat is, except for you.\n\nYou feel no interest in the novel playthings on show, or the crowds who gather to gawk at them. The hustle and bustle of the fair only heightens the unease you feel at the decision to meet here.\n\nA few weeks ago, a group of insurrectionists destroyed the lithin transfer hub in Tsath, before broadcasting a pre-recorded projection, repeating the same old cliches that \"Lithin is a demonic gift\" and that \"The Technocracy are destroying the world.\" Apart from titling themselves as \"Heralds of the Unenlightened,\" there was nothing to differentiate them from any other such malcontents.\n\nHowever, the ruler of Tsath declared that the insurrectionists had acted at the instigation of top figures within the metropolis, in hopes of provoking war between the two cities — even going so far as to provide evidence showing that each one was a metropolitan citizen.\n\nIn order to clear their name and defuse the situation, the metropolitan authorities requested the Technocratic Assembly's intervention, and it is to this end that you are here pursuing an investigation.\n\n\"My apologies, Mr. Detective, to have kept you waiting. This exhibition really is wonderful — it's been hard to tear myself away.\"\n\nJust as you are pondering the connection between these events, a short, rotund gentleman hails you from behind. It would appear that this is Akhra — the agent the Technocratic Assembly has sent to aid you in your investigation.\n\n\"You can dispense with the formalities, Akhra. Let's start with what we each know.\""},{"id":"Book1001","title":"Book1001","filename":"Book1001_EN.txt","text":"If you hadn't seen it with your own eyes, you would never have believed that this prosperous metropolis yet harbored the remnants of such a benighted age.\n\nAfter days of investigation, you and Akhra finally locate the insurrectionists known as \"The Unenlightened,\" hiding out in a decrepit church in the shadow of a hulking bridge.\n\nTheir location leaves you more convinced than ever that this is merely a band of luddites left behind in the wake of progress, and not some insidious tool of a more sinister political plot.\n\nRegardless, you need evidence to present before the Technocratic Assembly, and so you and Akhra decide to wait for the insurrectionists to leave their base — on one of their seemingly endless missions to transport some unknown cargo — before sneaking inside to gather the proof you need.\n\nYou stake out their hideout for a full three weeks before you finally seize your chance. By now you are sure that there are twelve of them coming and going from the church, and on this particular morning, they have all left together on their transport. Based on your observations, they are unlikely to return before dusk. Akhra stands sentry by the door, as you enter the church alone.\n\nThe long and winding corridor is filled with a sickly scent reminiscent of formaldehyde. You grope about in the dark until you finally find the exit. Perhaps because it is lit by archaic oil lamps, the inside of the church appears much larger than expected. In the dim light, you can just about make out stacks of strange metal vats along the walls. It must be these that the group has been transporting away.\n\nYou approach the vats carefully, noticing that each one has a label stuck to it, all of them displaying the single word: \"Ignorance.\"\n\n\"Perhaps this has something to do with some ancient religion,\" you think to yourself.\n\nJust as you are preparing to pick up one of the vats and take it with you to investigate, a pair of cold hands clamp down on your shoulders.\n\n\"Darn it!\"\n\nYou and Akhra had diligently staked out the church for three weeks, and only twelve people had entered or exited in all the time you were watching. Either this one had never left... or there was another exit you didn't know about.\n\nIn your panic, you kick open one of the metal vats. The stench of formaldehyde, the very same you detected while entering, is overpowering.\n\nThe pungent smell helps clear your head a little and you finally see clearly the man who has accosted you from behind. His face could charitably be described as human, but where his eyes should be, there are only two empty sockets set amidst twisted features.\n\n\"Did you see it? Did you see it?!\" He screams, thrusting out his thick arms and grasping at the air around him.\n\nHe is clearly blind — perhaps this is the reason you haven't seen him venture outside. Once you realize he can't see you, you quickly move back to the entrance of the room, and stumble out through the dark corridor outside.\n\n\"Hey, detective, what's going on? Hey, careful! What are you running for?\"\n\nThrough your fear and confusion, you hear your companion's voice, followed by a flurry of hurried footsteps as he quickly rushes over to your side.\n\nYour mission has not gone smoothly, yet you still have something to show for it. At the very least, you managed to take one of those strange vats with you as you fled.\n\nWith this realization in mind, you clamber to your feet. You look up to find a monstrosity gazing back at you, an apparition somewhere between a skeleton and a machine. Its face is sunken, a pair of lifeless, hollow eyes boring into you, and then a cold voice...\n\n\"You saw it, didn't you, 'Unenlightened One'?\""},{"id":"Book1002","title":"Book1002","filename":"Book1002_EN.txt","text":"A colossal head and slender limbs, connected by countless threads to a seemingly reptilian body.\n\n\"What you are looking at is a 'Human.'

The sight of its \"eyes\" still sends shivers down your spine.\n\n\"If this is a 'Human,' then what are we?\"\n\nYou ask the creature that, until recently, you had known as \"Akhra.\" Now that you think about it, it seems obvious that this would merely be a codename used in the Technocratic Assembly.\n\nBy means of some unfathomable technology, the church is connected to Natlantea. Perhaps every city has just such a place, somewhere to connect them in the dark.\n\n\"You? If you mean those that dwell on the surface... Pugs, beagles, little gray men... We have had many names for them through the ages...\"\n\n\"But whatever you choose to call them, they are creatures we designed. Their biological functions are in perfect contrast to our own — the environment in which we thrive is deathly toxic to them, and vice versa. It is precisely because of this that the degradation they cause is vital to recreating a world suited to our existence.\"\n\nIf things are really as this creature claims, the entire history of our civilization is the result of their planning, and the countless technological marvels and inventions that we now enjoy were bestowed on us by them.\n\nThey have always been right here beside us, and yet we never saw them. In their words, this is because of a gland in our brains that secretes a gaseous substance called \"the fog of reason,\" preventing us from perceiving the world as it truly is.\n\nThe only reason I can perceive this creature's hideous form right now is that I inhaled the gas known as \"Ignorance\" — a substance that I myself had created in my previous incarnation.\n\n\"I still have one more question: Having given us lithin, how can you guarantee that we'll destroy each other in a great war once it runs out?\"\n\n\"Lithin,\" the miraculous energy source discovered amongst the Natlantean ruins, is the energy-based form of these creatures. After their civilization had descended into a large-scale war that covered the planet in a hazardous substance, the surviving \"Humans\" decided to transfer their essence into pure energy and store themselves in a bio-vault deep underground.\n\nFollowing this, they designed a brand-new species, one that could survive on the polluted planet they had created. They hoped that this new species would aid in the biodegradation of the harmful substance until the surface was habitable again and they could begin anew.\n\nYet that new world would have no place for their creations. Once the surface dwellers discovered lithin and used it to advance their civilization, the ancient beings from beneath the earth would start to re-emerge. And so they wait for the day when surface civilization destroys itself a catastrophe that will give them new life.\n\n\"Perhaps you've heard of psychohistory? Or... probably not. It hardly matters. The point is, besides designing biological functions, the design of a species' history is also a simple matter of technology.\"\n\n\"The incessantly questing heart, the barely controllable greed, the drive for victory... It all leads them to the same inevitable conclusion. 'The Unenlightened' deny it, but that is only because your senseless morals have yet to be overcome by evolution.\"\n\nAt long last, you arrive at the final room in the deepest depths of the bio-vault, where the last memories of countless generations of The Unenlightened are stored.\n\nWhen the survivors of this ancient civilization decided to transfer their life force into lithin, there were those among them — though a minority — who resisted. They refused to abandon their individuality and merge into boundless, singular wisdom. Because of this, they were labeled \"The Unenlightened.\"\n\nThe majority were unable to deny them their rights, simply preserving for them this final room, allowing them to live out incarnation after incarnation among the lifeforms on the surface. Those who considered themselves enlightened believed that one day, their brethren would choose to join them and return to the embrace of the whole.\n\nIndeed, you are the leader of The Unenlightened. You have witnessed the countless memories of sages who established the codes of law, of poets who extolled the graces of virtue, and of warriors who fought against the oppression of tyrants.\n\nAt the start of each memory, you see a huge figure cast its shadow over those who were exiled from the ancient city. The figure seems to speak, but you can no longer recall the words. All you remember is that you yearn for him.\n\nPerhaps every generation of The Unenlightened eventually returns here to give their answer.\n\nIn that case, what will your answer be?"},{"id":"Book1003","title":"Book1003","filename":"Book1003_EN.txt","text":"First Place: Varesa\nSecond Place: Iansan\nThird Place: Sumac"},{"id":"Book1004","title":"Book1004","filename":"Book1004_EN.txt","text":"First Place: {NICKNAME}\nSecond Place: Varesa\nThird Place: Iansan"},{"id":"Book1005","title":"Book1005","filename":"Book1005_EN.txt","text":"<image name=UI_ReadPic_GroupPhotoFontaine_Boy_02/>\nDear {NICKNAME} and Paimon:\\nIt's been a while since you left Fontaine for Natlan.

In the dark, silent dream, she had already forgiven Sanhaj's crimes. Indeed, as a reward for his honesty, she poured the mysterious mushroom wine into an obsidian cup and handed it to him.\nHowever, at this moment, Kompore burst into his brother's tent and threw a rough hemp rope around his sleeping brother's neck — long had he known that his brother would reveal his plan to the Lord of the Crossroads.\nAnd so, before the master of dreams could even issue a warning, Sanhaj met his end at the hands of his own brother. The obsidian cup filled with mushroom wine slipped from his grasp, staining his chest and the bloodsoaked hemp rope tightly wound around his neck.\nThis grave crime enraged the Lord of the Crossroads, who grieved Sanhaj's death. He immediately laid a curse upon the cunning Kompore: his unhappy brother Sanhaj would be resurrected within him, and would prophesize the fullness of his fate.

Thus, the Lord of the Night blinded all who weave tales, compelling them to focus on stories while being unable to see the present, causing them to be pricked by the cold moonlight as with needles, yet never to witness the three moons' death with their own eyes. Therefore, the great master of riddles and allegories remains forever an indiscernible, indescribable mist upon a tapestry.\n\nThe tale the craftsmen wove next intertwined whispers from the Night-Lord's broken visage. Legends speak of a warrior named Coquitao, one of the Masters of the Night-Wind's precursors, whose soul's homeland lay beneath a distant midnight, under a frigid sun. Bearing the stone club Makana, he wandered the earth, following a contract forged with gods dead and cold, his life steeped in war and chaos. It is said that on a night of wind and rain, he made a wordless pact with the deity of the dog days, thereby mortgaging his fate to the Kame Twins from a plague-ridden land.\n\nThe deity of the dog days bade Coquitao punish the deluded ones who had forgotten death, to bring down freezing smoke and dreams from the starry sky, and distribute them to the people. Thus, Coquitao used \"Makana\" to bring forth death irreversible, guiding the masterless souls back to the deep black river of Mictlan, returning them to the Night-Lord's slumber.\n\nEver did Coquitao's fingers grip Makana as he trudged knee-deep in blood. Countless days and nights of struggle and slaughter at last pacified the madness that had torn through the starry skies. His companions followed behind him, one among them named Nagual, a cunning shapeshifter from a distant scorched land that burns endlessly even now.\n\nWhen the last fantasist was executed by Coquitao and his companions, when the river of blood at last pleased the jade-skirted master who dwelled above the thundering clouds, and who then called down sweet rains to cleanse all rivers, the deity of the dog days refused to return the hero's soul, instead commanding the treacherous Kame Twins to direct the despicable Nagual in secret. Thus steered, Nagual hewed Coquitao's head with an obsidian blade.\n\nAnd so, headless Coquitao failed to complete his covenant with the deity of the dog days, and could only blindly follow the Tzitzimimeh in their wandering."},{"id":"Book1022","title":"Book1022","filename":"Book1022_EN.txt","text":"Seeing her chosen hero meet such a miserable fate, the mistress of heavenly stars was filled with grief and anger, and she instructed her Tzitzimimeh to descend to the earth.

Some say he transformed into a black spirit leopard, silently passing through forests and plains, bringing nightmares and inspiration to priests deep in meditation.\n\nThus did Coquitao wander through long nights uncounted, transforming into unnumbered forms, traversing lands awash with blood, winding through altars that once pleased the lord of the skies. But at last, he found the despicable traitor Nagual in the land of scorched and burning soil, even as the latter rested at an oasis, sipping a poisonous serpent's blood and hallucinogenic Mexicali juices.\n\nThen headless Coquitao raised Makana on high and struck, the blow shattering the traitor's skull like the illusory Mexicali oracle.

If memory serves, Aj Awaj K'umilal Kan Ch'ule-L has been absent from the sessions of this council for quite some time. Tell me, Speaker, is that disdainful, decadent, decrepit old thing still holed up in his lonely citadel atop the high cliffs, lost in his futile research on the Phlogistonization of Life? Or has he already perished like the Sixth and Tenth Lords, drowned in his own folly and decay?\n\nCL-01: According to the Fourth Lord, the research he has been undertaking has now reached a critical juncture. As such, he has been unable to participate in our recent councils.\n\nCL-11: Hah, I doubt that. He is merely looking for an excuse to neglect his duties. If he truly loves research so much, why not relinquish his title as a sovereign ruler and instead serve under the Regent, who seems to share his facile obsession with technology?\n\nCL-01: Watch your tone, Eleventh Lord. His absence will not hinder the proceedings of this vote.\n\nCL-07: Let him rot in his domain. Speaker, begin the deliberations.\n\nCL-01: Then let us proceed. This session has been convened upon the initiative of the Fifth Lord, who proposes that — in the interest of mitigating the risk of rebellion and ensuring long-term prosperity, stability, and peace — the sovereign rulers implement the neutralization of human settlements exceeding a certain scale within each of their respective territories. Should consensus be reached, even abstainers will be bound to uphold the council's decision. Let the session commence. Fifth Lord, you may now present your case.\n\nCL-05: Comrades, brothers and sisters, esteemed sovereign rulers, hear my words. As you all know, of the Thirteen Sovereign Lords who govern Natlantea, two have already fallen to humanity's schemes. My reasons for bringing forth this proposal need no further elaboration — I only hope that you will not continue to ignore the truth. At this very moment, the species known as humanity has become a threat to our noble kind. Their propagation and expansion have far exceeded our initial predictions, and now they have even stolen the secrets of wielding phlogiston. Admittedly, their understanding of phlogiston remains as crude as an Aphid's, yet the heights to which their overweening arrogance and ambition soar may be compared to that detestable reaver from beyond the skies. If left unchecked, the kindling of rebellion will only grow more dangerous. As such, I, Aj K'astajibal Cha'ama' Ho'o Ch'ule-L, overseer of Ek' Pulinik, propose to this council: To keep their numbers within a controllable range, we must periodically neutralize human settlements within our domains by incinerating the excess. Clearly, such a course of action would require coordination among all present — lest the humans, in their cunning malevolence, flee across our territories, and in so doing escape their ordained fate, thereby undermining the effectiveness of such measures.\n\nCL-02: The Sixth and Tenth Lords fell to their own weakness and incompetence. I have read the reports compiled by the Servants, and I can find no better word to describe them than disgraceful. The Sixth Lord was bested in combat by a mere human, then felled by a single arrow to the throat. The Tenth Lord's fate was even more contemptible — deceived into mistaking a crude human imitation of jade for my token, then ending up being sealed alive within the mountains. You should be grateful to the humans who killed them, for if they could be brought low by such creatures, what right did they have to sit among us as sovereign rulers?\n\nCL-05: The matter at hand has nothing to do with how they perished, Jade Maiden.\n\nCL-02: Do not mistake me, Fifth Lord. I do not stand in opposition to your proposal — on the contrary, I will cast my vote in its favor, for humanity is worthy of neither our clemency nor our tolerance. Yet still, I do not find your reasoning sound. If the day ever comes when humans truly imperil our kind, it would but prove that our kind have indeed grown too weak. And in their decline, they would deserve only to kneel before their subjugators and accept destined destruction, for there would be no need, nor possibility, to seek an alternative. The strong endure, the weak perish — that is the eternal truth of this world. Do not forget it.\n\nCL-03: I abstain. The fate of these soulless creatures bound to star signs concerns me not. Do with them as you will.\n\nCL-09: I, too, shall abstain. Fifth Lord, surely you do not truly hope to persuade us that these wretched insects, these creatures who know naught but to cower in the dark and slaughter one another without end, will one day suddenly unite? That they might march upon the Sacred City, which not even the usurper of the sky could shake? Such absurd hysteria from a dragon, such loathsome cowardice... Unworthy even of my defiance.\n\nCL-13: You and your arrogance are what is truly loathsome, Ninth Lord. If you do not support this lofty-minded proposal, then go, wriggle back to your beloved Chichen Uctokah. Continue there in self-deception, pretending your land will never be threatened by these insects, for even the most witless ants would not be so foolish as to burrow into that bone-chilling well of yours.\n\nCL-09: You...! You dare mock me, wretched worm!?\n\nCL-08: Wherefore comes such ire, Thirteenth Lord? The ruler of Chichen Uctokah has spoken nothing but the truth. If humanity cannot be eradicated entirely, such drastic measures will only backfire in the end. Rather than pacifying them as you intend, you will only spur them on to cease their incessant infighting and unite against us. If that is your proposal, Fifth Lord, then for the future of our kind, I stand in firm opposition to such folly.\n\nCL-07: Oh? The Priestess of Floral Candles and Skyborne Feathers would lecture us on \"the future of our kind\"? I remind you, Eighth Lord, that you hold no standing in this matter — for you have long since forsaken duty to your kin in favor of a misguided partiality for humanity. To this day, you have yet to explain why you employed dragon artisans of your domain to forge a longbow for your little human pet. Was this not a blatant overstepping of your mandate?\n\nCL-08: You stray from the topic, Seventh Lord. Furthermore, my actions were sanctioned by our Sovereign, and I have never yet exceeded that mandate. I owe no explanations to the weak.\n\nCL-12: You need not explain yourself to others, for already, I have grasped your full intent. Indeed, as the Eighth Lord has stated, such drastic measures can hardly be deemed efficient. Humanity should instead be manipulated into regulating their own numbers. We need only select and support certain individuals from the shadows, bestowing upon them the necessary resources and aid to seize power over their tribes. With such support, they can easily be shepherded into betraying their own kin — driven by their innate vanity and the need to secure their tenuous positions. Willingly they shall foment conflict with other tribes, spilling one another's blood and shattering whatever fragile trust may have existed between them. This alone shall suffice, so why go to unnecessary lengths and expend our own resources on a far less efficient plan?\n\nCL-11: One might almost have mistaken such feeble words for the self-conceited ramblings of some human whelp, Twelfth Lord. Have you spent so much time among the fawning livestock in your domains that you have forgotten our way? Have you fallen so low as to measure your wit against insects, disdaining even to hunt them yourself?\n\nCL-12: I have no interest in responding to your infantile insults, dear sister. Even the bestial hisses of those sunken degenerates, those mindless lizards who spend their lives groveling in the dust, have more worth than such senseless drivel. Of course, you may hunt as you will — that right is beyond dispute. However, out of genuine respect and concern for my brethren, I sincerely hope that you do not follow in the footsteps of the Sixth and Tenth Lords, who foolishly squandered their not-so-lofty lives out of sheer arrogance and folly.\n\nCL-11: You—!\n\nCL-01: Silence. All sovereign rulers present have spoken. The vote shall now be held.\n\n[Vote Count]\nFor: CL-02, CL-05, CL-07, CL-11, CL-13\nAgainst: CL-08, CL-12\nAbstained: CL-01, CL-03, CL-09\n\nFinal Tally: 5 in favor, 2 against, 3 abstentions.

Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop...\n\n————\n\nThe shopkeeper, who had fox-like eyes with slender lines for pupils, opened the glass double doors to let in the bright moonlight, which seemed to sweep up the stardust from across the night sky and sprinkle it down upon the counter.\nEverything, from the ostentatious flowers, the dust-covered harpastum, and the old books rendered illegible by years of erosion, to the now-stringless old longbow, appeared as the opulent halls of the ruling aristocrats might have done in times of old — covered in a shiny silver coating, though this was a silver that came from the cold light of the night sky.\n\n\"Hey. Business any good these days?\"\nThis audacious alternative to the courteous greeting most people would opt for in the circumstances came from somewhere deep in the back of the shop.\nThe shopkeeper turned around. A familiar customer was sat nonchalantly on her armchair in the part of the shop that the moonlight did not reach.\n\n\"Business is fine. But these days, it would appear, I need to watch out for burglars.\"\nThe shopkeeper responded with a slight smile.\n\"That's it? You're going to turn away your oldest customer, just like that?\"\nThe customer let out a sigh, \"There's nothing in your shop that's worth me spending money on anyway. I mean, if I really had to pick something...\"\n\n\"Well? How was the... hunt?\"\n\"What do you mean? You think I'm just here to offload some loot again?\"\nThe \"hunter\" let out a displeased grunt at the shopkeeper's insinuation. But the shopkeeper continued to smile.\n\"Why, of course not. When have I ever heard you use the word \"loot\" before?\"\n\"On the contrary... all the \"exchanged goods,\" \"free gifts,\" \"philanthropic donations,\" \"bestowals\" and so on that you have so generously given over the years... why, they must make you the most charitably inclined burglar to roam the streets, no?\"\n\n\"Well, that's not why I'm here this time. This time I am here to ask for something from you... the wine. That special wine you've got that helps you forget about the one you long for.\"\nThough a burglar by trade, this customer was nevertheless valiant at heart. His words lacked courtesy, but the smile on his face was entirely earnest.\n\n\"I'm terribly sorry. Somebody has already bought it.\"\nHe looked, and somehow, she was now holding in her hand the wine flask that he had discreetly slipped into his breast pocket earlier.\n\"Each item in this store is spoken for. This particular one has already been bought by a customer who will turn up at some point in the future.\"\n\"It seems your sleight of hand is superior to my own. What a disgrace I am...\"\nThe burglar of valor said with a pained smile.\n\"I discovered recently that the feeling of longing for someone is heavier to carry than gold. In my line of work I am forever leaping between rooftops and running along rafters. I need to cut out whatever... unnecessary weight I can.\"\n\"...I wonder if the girl with the sapphire-blue eyes feels the same weight that I feel?\"\n\n————\n\nSuddenly, the shopkeeper was startled by the jingle of the door bell.\nThe customer who had just arrived was a blue-eyed sorceress with a Pole in her hand and a tall, slender figure to match. The marks on her face bore witness to her persecution by the aristocrats.\nIgnoring the piles of random objects strewn around the store, she marched straight to the counter like a sword lunging toward its opponent's heart.\n\n\"Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\"\n\"I have an item I wish to exchange.\"\nHer tone sounded cold but fragile, like thin ice in the moment that it shatters. As the sorceress spoke, she placed a giant blue crystal onto the counter.\n\"A burglar pried this from an aristocrat's silver goblet. He gave it to me as a gift, and then I was punished by my master for it.\"\n\"But that was many years ago. I had thought that with the passage of time my anger would be quenched and my desire to see him again would fade away...\"\n\n\"Very well. What sum of Mora do you ask for in return?\"\nThe sorceress gestured toward the tableware cabinet, in which stood an aristocrat's silver goblet with its gemstone missing.\nThe fox-eyed shopkeeper turned the crystal in her hand, flooding the room with the brilliant blue light that reflected off its surface.\n\"I see. Well, provided that this is what you really want...\"\n\nWhen a person encounters a setback, the worry that everything shall come to a fruitless conclusion appears. The advent of fear causes cracks to appear in the mind.\nDeath follows easily in the footsteps of fear, like a damp cold that, to the unprepared, pierces to the bone.\nFor many, it is only in the moment that death is upon them that it dawns on them that their weakness has now been targeted with fatal consequences — and that at some point, therefore, that weakness must have been exposed.\n\nLifting the blue crystal up into the moonlight, the shopkeeper gazed at it intently with her fox-like eyes with slender lines for pupils. She watched with delight as the crest of the ruling family came into view, faded out, and came back into view once more.\nLegends claim that peering into a pure gemstone at a specific time can reveal the past, the future, and even someone's true nature. Just as legends claim that somewhere in the world, there is a field of dandelions as vast as the sea. Or that once there were three bright moons in the night sky named Aria, Sonnet and Canon, sisters who were parted by death in a great catastrophe. Or that there was once a witch who could see death before it took place, but in the end herself died from a broken heart, as he who had stolen it from her waited in distant lands longing to see her again.\nOne thing she knew for certain was that even if she were to abandon these objects, the legends attached to them would not disappear, and the way the stories ended could not be undone.\nIn which case, it seemed to make sense to collect all the legends and stories she could in her shop."},{"id":"Book1040","title":"Book1040","filename":"Book1040_EN.txt","text":"No.: B-CL-16130\nAgenda: Motion for the Execution of Sovereign Ruler Ix Ajkotz'i'j Iq'ismal Waxak\nAttendees:\nCL-01 \"Valiant One\" Aj Nimalaj Chuq'ab Hun\nCL-02 \"Jade Maiden\" Ix Je'lal K'ua'l Ka'\nCL-03 \"Weaver of Secrets\" Ix Kemonel Jasjatem Oox\nCL-05 \"Bestower of Bitter Springs\" Aj K'astajibal Cha'ama' Ho'o\nCL-07 \"Toxic Rain Over Boundless Forests\" Aj Chojojik Kamikabal U'uk\nCL-08 \"Priestess of Floral Candles and Skyborne Feathers\" Ix Ajkotz'i'j Iq'ismal Waxak\nCL-12 \"Murmuring Spring\" Ix Roq'ratik'obala' Ka'alahun\n\n[Record Begins]\nCL-01: I demand that you explain yourself immediately, Twelfth Lord.

The words I wish to speak — the words I must speak — have already been made clear in my proposal. I, Ix Roq'ratik'obala' Ka'alahun Ch'ule-L, custodian of Q'umqaraq'aj, accuse the Eighth Lord among us, Ix Ajkotz'i'j Iq'ismal Waxak Ch'ule-L, of betraying our kind, and thus request her immediate execution. Instead of pressing me yet again on matters you already know, why not first question the Eighth Lord herself to see what she might say in her own defense?\n\nCL-08: I have no intention of defending myself. If any of you believe I have betrayed our kind and defiled our Sovereign's vision, then cast your vote for my execution. Only a weakling would waste words on such matters.\n\nCL-12: How dignified your haughty grace, my dear sister. Yet as I see it, you are merely grasping for an excuse — one you cannot find — to explain your own betrayal. How else would you justify why the human you keep — that vile reaver, that brazen harborer of degenerates we had exiled, that insect who dared trespass upon my domain whom you dare call \"daughter,\" who wields a weapon forged by dragon-smiths — has chosen to follow in Xbalanque's path, assisting him in slaughtering our kin? And why, even now, do you continue to tolerate her savagery rather than cast her out yourself? Is that not so, our ever-venerable Paragon Priestess of Floral Candles and Skyborne Feathers?\n\nCL-08: You name me a traitor, Twelfth Lord. If I truly were one, you would now be lying at my feet, begging for mercy to save your pitiful life. As for my beloved daughter, you have no right to make such accusations. She has chosen her path, just as I have chosen to remain loyal to our Sovereign. If a weak worm like you cannot even kill her, or maintain the territory granted to you by our Sovereign — then that is your fault, neither mine nor hers.\n\nCL-01: I, too, refute your accusation, Twelfth Lord. The human named Xbalanque is a powerful warrior, worthy of our respect. Even in my eyes, he has shown himself worthy of facing me in combat, and of my killing him in person. This is a fact that you should respect. That humanity's offspring would flock to his banner is as natural as the idea that a plant would turn towards the sun, or that its seeds would drift along with the wind. This stands beyond reproach, and certainly does not constitute treason.\n\nCL-07: You would speak in puny humanity's defense?\n\nCL-01: I have no intention of defending anyone, Seventh Lord. My words are crystal clear, surely as my teeth gleam with the brilliance of gemstones. I esteem the formidable enemy named Xbalanque, just as I long to tear open his chest in glorious battle, and to bathe my very heart in his blood out of respect for his nobility. If you would call this a defense, I would not mind so defending your honor either, Seventh Lord.\n\nCL-07: ...I request your pardon. It was not my intent to provoke you.\n\nCL-01: Such an outrageous proposal is itself an affront to the Chamber of Deliberation. I, too, do not consider following Xbalanque to be an unforgivable crime. Perhaps you should call for my execution as well?\n\nCL-02: The Eighth Lord speaks the truth in this matter. If you cannot defeat even a puny human, Twelfth Lord, then truly you all deserve to perish.\n\nCL-05: You would deny her betrayal too, Jade Maiden?\n\nCL-02: I would not deign to label the Eighth Lord a traitor. Yet my regard for you, Eighth Lord, does not sway me sufficiently to reject this proposal either. Even if the possibility of your betrayal is but one in a hundred thousand, that sliver of corruption is enough to repulse me.

Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop...\n\n————\n\n\"Is anybody in?\" The man tapped on the front door as he called out. He was draped in a raincoat.\nHe peered in through the dusty windows at the objects on display around the store — a bottle of glimmering stardust, a broken blade that gleamed like ice, a painting on a roll of paper that the years had turned yellow, an elixir that gave off a mysterious aurora, a tile thinly coated with a gel-like substance...\nHe entered the store. The door closed behind him.\nHe walked over to the counter and began inspecting the weird and wonderful objects in the store. All seemed to be relics from a bygone era. Then, a soft female voice came from beside him.\n\"Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\"\n\nTaken by surprise, he turned to face the speaker, a fox-eyed shopkeeper, who let out a faint smile.\n\"Here's the thing... I'm looking for a certain something that can help me settle an old score.\"\nThe man spoke with a voice that was clear and resonant, but that had a hint of apprehensiveness about it — one which did not seem to fit with his physical appearance.\n\"Oh? Very well then.\"\nThe shopkeeper's golden fox-like eyes flickered as she examined this new customer of hers who was draped in a soaking-wet raincoat. She gave a nod.\nShe leaned down to search in the bottom of the cabinet. When she stood up a moment later, she was holding a large and beautiful piece of Cor Lapis.\n\nThe Cor Lapis in the shopkeeper's hand gently glowed a dark shade of gold, much in the same way that her eyes did.\nThe man took the stone from her hand and studied it closely in the moonlight. In this light, the Cor Lapis seemed to reveal a deep turbulence concealed within its soft golden hue.\nHis hands were still trembling.\n\n\"Cor Lapis is the soul of the rocks. Even the hardest and most resilient of rocks will, over time, eventually produce a pure, limpid soul.\"\nThe shopkeeper's voice seemed to be coming from a distant place. The man gave a nod.\n\"This is precisely what I was looking for.\"\nThe man solemnly responded, and placed a heavy sack of Mora upon the counter. Then, he left the store and ventured off into the midnight rain.\n\n————\n\n\"That's what happened.\"\nAfter the shopkeeper had spoken, she narrowed her fox-like eyes and examined the customer in front of her.\n\"Did he say nothing else at all?\"\nJudging by his appearance, the young man was presumably a miner. His eyes betrayed an urgency that he could not contain. But the shopkeeper responded simply by calmly shaking her head.\n\"He left a sack of Mora with blood stains on the outside.\"\nLike a pool of water, the shopkeeper's voice was calm and still, but also icy cold.\n\n\"That is precisely what I was looking for.\"\nThe young man let out a long sigh. It seemed he wanted to evade the golden gaze of the fox-eyed shopkeeper.\n\"In return, I will give you a story.\"\nThe shopkeeper nodded her head to indicate that he should continue.\n\"That man in the raincoat... I used to go mining with him, up in the mountains. I wanted to make a name for myself. He just wanted to support his family...\"\n\"One rainy night we broke open a rock to find that substantial piece of Cor Lapis inside. The pure golden glow that radiated from its surface was a more breathtaking sight to behold than all the marvels of Jueyun Karst put together...\"\n\"We agreed that we would split it fifty-fifty once we got back to Liyue Harbor. But that night, under cover of the deafening roar of the torrential rain... I discreetly made it so that that clifftop would be his final resting place...\"\n\"I did it because I was scared I couldn't trust him... I couldn't trust in a promise that, aside from ourselves, only the adepti could have heard — and they're probably imaginary anyway.\"\n\"So... Fear won me over. I could bring myself to accept that the whole sum could be mine if I was willing to get blood on my hands, but I couldn't bring myself to accept the risk of traveling with a stranger...\"\n\n\"The following morning, I let down my rope and began my descent down the cliff. I had taken maybe four steps, five or six perhaps, and I was adjusting my footing on a rock when suddenly, I felt the rope trembling in the palms of my hands... Instantly that same trembling permeated every fiber of my being...\"\n\"I lifted my head to look at the rope, but it was too late...\"\n\"The last thing I remember seeing was the torn rope fibers at the end of the snapped rope.\"\n\"Only a hunting knife could have made a clean cut like that. I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Then, in the end, you two settled your score.\"\nThe fox-eyed shopkeeper smiled so faintly it was all but indiscernible.\n\"He takes the Cor Lapis, and you take the whole sum of money for it.\"\nThe young man did not say much in reply.\n\n————\n\nLegends claim that Cor Lapis is the soul of the rocks of the earth, and that the stronger the life force of the rock the more power it possesses to reveal a person's true nature.\nSome say that even after its owner has left the world, Cor Lapis will bring their unfulfilled desire and regret back into it, waiting for one with the ability to fulfill them.\nSo the legends claim.\nIt had now been around four hours since the two strange customers had left the store. The rain continued to pour down.\nThe shopkeeper stood by the window for a long time, peering out at the dark street engulfed in misty rain.\n\"But... Is the score truly settled? And are they now truly free? \"\nShe spoke as if posing her question to the curtain of rain, but knowing that the answer would never come."},{"id":"Book1050","title":"Book1050","filename":"Book1050_EN.txt","text":"<image name=UI_ReadPic_Experiment_Map_03/>\n<image name=UI_ReadPic_Experiment_Map_02/>\n<image name=UI_ReadPic_Experiment_Map_01/>"},{"id":"Book1051","title":"Book1051","filename":"Book1051_EN.txt","text":"<image name=UI_ReadPic_Experiment_Map_01/>"},{"id":"Book1052","title":"Book1052","filename":"Book1052_EN.txt","text":"(A letter received several months ago)\n...It was you.

Now it really stands out in my backpack. It's perfect! Tonight, I'll put it beside my pillow before I go to sleep — there's no way I can lose it then. Honestly, I don't think I can keep calling myself an adventurer if I lose my diary one more time... a misadventurer, perhaps.\n\nI headed westward from the mountain pass at Mt. Tianheng and came to a ruin, known locally as Qingxu Pool. The entrance to the ruin is located right in the center of a giant rocky outcrop rising up from the center of a shallow pool. It is surrounded on all sides by steep cliff faces. There are several stone towers which blend in seamlessly with the natural scenery put here by the Geo Archon. The morning mist is beginning to clear and the first rays of sunlight are starting to illuminate the mountains and ruins. It looks like it'll be good weather today.\n\nLegends say that these ruins predate the Geo Archon's rule over Liyue. The whole of Lisha was covered by water at the time of the Archon War, and back then this rocky outcrop was nothing more than a little islet that rose above the water's surface. After peace was restored, the region of Lisha unfurled once more as the tides withdrew, revealing the ancient buildings erected by the early peoples.\n\nBack when I was at the Wangshu Inn I met a scholar from Sumeru called Soraya. She had done a fair bit of research on the ruins in Lisha. Once she got talking about it she could talk all day. What she told me was that these ruins were left behind by an evil god, whose name has been wiped from the record, and its people. But in the end, the sea gave way to forests and fields, the self-serving god was defeated, and the strongholds and temples of the ancient city the god's people once built were left to crumble. That is how Qingxu Pool came to be. The ruins were submerged until the long Archon War finally came to an end, emerging on the landscape as the tide subsided.\n\nMaybe these crumbling remains have been left as a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era for the adepti and the other deities. In any case, this is a calm and tranquil place that has, for whatever reason, remained entirely unperturbed by the relentless development of Liyue Harbor and untouched by the mining operation based at the Chasm. It has just been left, as-is, right to this day. Perversely, the only disturbances have come since the mining at the Chasm has been halted, as monsters have now occupied the ruins here. Let's just hope they don't destroy anything.\n\nIt is a simple theory, but I need to gather more evidence. I should keep heading north and visit the ruins at Lingju Pass and Dunyu.\n\nI ran into Eduardo again just before I set off. She seemed to be traveling with a partner this time.

Why is it so obsessed with dyeing the flower fields in such ominous colors? Yesterday it was a mess of purple and orange, like a twisting, flying serpent from the desert. The day before that was an awful clash of red and green, with circles of all shapes and sizes scattered throughout. A single glance forces me to stop and consciously regulate my breathing for a while, lest my heart starts skipping bars instead of beats. The creature may fancy itself an artist, but its \"art\" is avant-garde to the point of absurdity. Who could even stand to look at these?\n\nLately, I've been spending all my time waging war against it. I once wondered if I could block it out — keep it from entering the play area, but the whole field is too large to block off. I tried to block the Asha's route itself, but by the time I set up a fence, I realized the blasted thing can jump higher than a Yumkasaurus. And once I dropped my guard, it got right back to its \"artistic endeavors.\" I swear, it's driving me crazy. I can't chase it, I can't catch it. It paints, and I clean up, and I tell you, cleanup takes forever. Once I wipe the sweat off my brow, I raise my head and get treated to the sight of its next painting.

But nobody cared for some brash upstart from the Collective of Plenty, so there were few people around him... leaving me as his most conspicuous spectator.\n\nHis speech wasn't bad. He wasn't the sort who loved to flatter others, and his words were simple and sincere. He believed in himself and his goal. Like a wildfire, brave and fearless... I can't recall all the details by now, but I know that his excitement infected me.\n\nStill, nobody applauded him, and no one spoke to him. Watching the noisy crowd leave him behind, the man merely smiled and sighed, then he bent down to pick up his backpack.

It was a beautiful name, and full of meaning.\n\nNowadays, it seems to describe us perhaps too well.\n\nWe were the ones who wanted to spread the name of the Flintblades throughout Teyvat, but that dream's yet to come true. Once we had our child, we were the first to turn back...\n\nFor the friends who trusted us and accompanied us on all our adventures thus far, our decision is undoubtedly a selfish one.\n\nBut as parents, what could be more important than protecting our child as he grows up?\n\nAfter all this time together, we already sense what our friends' answers will be — yet it does nothing to dull the guilt within. Saying farewell has never been an easy choice, least of all for our leader.\n\nOr perhaps this is just another sort of adventure for us. Right now, it's my turn to give Macani courage, after he did the same to me in the past.\n\n...\n\nOur friends said they knew this day would come... They teased us for a while, but my heart doesn't feel as heavy anymore. Macani looks to be in better spirits, too.\n\nAnja suggested organizing a final farewell trip so we can enjoy one last holiday together... That's just like her. She knows how to keep everyone happy and doesn't want us to leave with any regrets.\n\nIt's time to get busy again. Aside from all the packing, I'd like to prepare some special gifts for my friends.\n\nOh, right, I should also find a new album so I can store more pictures from our travels."},{"id":"Book1068","title":"Book1068","filename":"Book1068_EN.txt","text":"My 14th pause to rest.

I am Mbande's successor. I shall be like Daurama, Nayoga, and Sanhaj. I will weave ancient texts into a tapestry, I shall speak of the foundations of phlogiston-forging, and spare you needless detours.\n\n...\n\nChapter V: Another Possibility for Phlogiston-Forging Techniques\n\nAccording to the scroll left behind by our great-mother, Sakkuk, the techniques of phlogiston-forging originated from the ancient dragons. In their era, there existed a more marvelous forging method beyond present imagination, one that directly forged Phlogiston into different materials.\n\nSuch mastery was witnessed by Sakkuk, and the founding pioneer, Ixquieh, earned her title as \"Hero of the Forged Flame\" by truly understanding how to smelt phlogiston itself. She was no dragon — but having had no parents to grant her a name, she named herself in draconic tongue and style. So in theory, mastery of this advanced phlogiston-forging art was within human reach.\n\nRegrettably, Ixquieh's manuscripts number few and far between. She set fire to her own workshop, including her writings about forging, and took her own life while forcing her brother do the same, to avoid his leaving a tarnished legacy like that of Och-Kan. In a sense, it was she who slew her own kin, Teteocan's first chief. I cannot pass judgment on that choice, as each era has its morals. Yet the loss of such craftsmanship is regretful, and haunts future smiths still.\n\nThe 13th chief, Hun Toh, — may fire bless his name — spent his entire life trying to grasp the art of phlogiston-forging, but found no success. I tried it in my youth and failed as well. To you, smiths of future ages: You may try, but do not squander your years and strength. For weaving matter with phlogiston is like building an unshakable house from ground Grainfruit dust, all while tracking the placement of each speck. One misstep, and the entire structure will collapse. Based on my experience, with our current technological constraints, ordinary humans cannot attain this great endeavor. Therefore, I advise you to focus on using phlogiston as a supplementary material for tempering metals and jade rather than treating it as the foundational substrate of your forging.\n\nBut this does not spell our defeat, nor our inability to surpass our ancestors and the ancient dragons. Remember, phlogiston is but a tool, and as a craftsman, it is your hand that guides the tool, not the other way around. After all, only a craftsman — you, a human — can materialize ideas and concepts into reality.\n\nIn fact, many recorded ideas from Sakkuk's time have been realized by now, even though no smith in these centuries has ever mastered the forging of phlogiston itself. Take, for instance, golden discs that preserve song and melody, platforms suspended briefly aloft by phlogiston, or vehicles that may carry us over all manner of terrain. Such marvels abound! Future generations of craftsmen — may they live in peaceful times — might build upon these techniques to achieve wonders beyond our era's imagination. This is the legacy of Nanatzcayan: A \"blessing\" born of mortal hands, not the boon of gods or masters.\n\n..."},{"id":"Book1074","title":"Book1074","filename":"Book1074_EN.txt","text":"...\n\nAj Awaj K'umilal Kan stormed into my laboratory in a fit of rage. He interrogated me, demanding to know if I had taught the humans how to use phlogiston. I assuaged his fury with Quenepa Berries and asked what had happened.\n\nAccording to his account, it seems that a human colony near Q'umqaraq'aj has mastered the power of phlogiston and begun to expand. In the last three months, they've razed over (...) villages, sacrificed roughly (...) human victims, and clogged the River Tz'alam's very flow with discarded (...). Their leader claims to be the \"Successor of Chaac,\" swearing to end the age of dragons and to unite the people of Natlantea under a single banner. Ix Roq'ratik'obala' Ka'alahun quelled the uprising in two days. The would-be conqueror was drowned in his own bath by his most favored consort, a captive turned killer. Leaderless, the tribe collapsed into internecine strife. Yet the secrets of phlogiston had already spread, now utterly beyond containment.\n\n\"Hmph... If you, milord, with your tender heart, have not sanctioned this folly, then the only one mad enough to dare would be...\"\n\nAwaj did not finish his sentence, muttering under his breath as he left. Truth be told, he likely concerns himself little about humans mastering phlogiston. His fury stems solely from the crudeness of their methods, a blasphemy against his life's work.\n\nBut I care. I cannot comprehend why Kukulkan (for it must be him, after all, no other would do such a foolish thing) would hand phlogiston over to the humans. I can understand his antipathy for these tiny lifeforms, brought by the usurper from beyond the sky, but I cannot comprehend his use of this method to lure them into destroying themselves. It is like handing a rusty knife to a wailing infant — all too vicious, and all too cruel. What outcome could he possibly expect, save for suffering and death?\n\n...\n\nI met with Kukulkan in private and asked him about his intentions.\n\nAs usual, he remained enigmatic and aloof. He coldly denied all accusations. He claimed that I was not truly concerned about how this matter harmed the interests of dragonkind, and that an opportunistic attempt to grab power drove my belief in such absurd slander. So infuriated was I that I burst into laughter. After refuting his accusations with a few choice words, and without even finishing my Quenepa Berries, I departed.\n\nHe is always like this. He scorns his kin, mocks his bloodline, and never shares his thoughts with other dragons, yet he resents them for failing to understand him. But if he refuses to speak his mind, how could anyone ever fathom what he truly intends?\n\nOur Sovereign's indulgence toward him knows no bounds, so much so that he can no longer distinguish right from wrong. Whether his actions were just or misguided, the Sovereign would always respond with gentle agreement. And precisely because of this, his unease only grows deeper. No matter which path he takes, he is always met with the same tender light, leaving him utterly lost as to which road he truly walks. In the end, his suspicions toward his kin are nothing but reflections of his self-doubt.\n\nI pity him."},{"id":"Book1075","title":"Book1075","filename":"Book1075_EN.txt","text":"...\n\nThe consequences of the phlogiston theft worsen by the day. Most of the other rulers allow humans to use phlogiston to kill and conquer each other, some even encouraging them to commit more atrocities. They seem to see this as an effective means of controlling the human population... or perhaps they derive mere amusement from it.\n\nThe flood of refugees surging northward grows ever larger, and the tidings they bring grow ever more horrifying. The chieftain of Kacho'pinik offered his daughter in marriage to the leader of the Culhua, hoping to win their allegiance. Yet the Culhua instead cut out her (...), sacrificed her to (...), and marched (...) upon their villages, for their food stores were more abundant. They do not understand how we extract vitality from blood, yet they ape our ways nonetheless, offering up meaningless slaughter to their imagined gods.\n\nI spoke with Kemonel. Even she felt a pang of reluctance, though her pity was not for humans, but for her own kin, now reduced to mere beasts. More and more humans have begun taming vishaps, turning them into tools of slaughter, for even stripped of their intellect, their claws and fangs still rend flesh with ease. Thus, Kemonel has sought to ally with those humans who yearned for peace, hoping to harness their souls to weave an eternal, blissful dream-realm for the dragons of her domain. Even the unfortunate fallen might shed the forms that imprison them and find happiness and solace within this dream.\n\nIt is not an unfeasible plan, but her approach would inevitably weaken oversight of human settlements, inviting greater suffering upon these frail creatures who have come from beyond the skies.\n\nThe sorrow of humankind stems from their lack of hierarchy. Dragons are born to submit to their superiors and command their inferiors. Even if I appeared before them in human guise, they would instantly catch my scent, recognize my station, and obey my orders — for it is the law carved into their blood, their path ordained by nature, for the weak to revere the strong, offspring to follow their sire, and subjects to serve their sovereign. But humans are different. Humans are born to deceive their betters, torment weaker kin, and even betray entire clans — or slaughter the very blood that gave them life — for nothing but selfish gain. Their eyes reflect no path that belongs to them, or if they did, they shall doubtless invent endless excuses to forsake said path. Without proper guidance and restraint, they repeat the same atrocities, never learning from their past misdeeds.\n\nAll defilement of life is blasphemy, an unforgivable stain upon our Sovereign's honor. Thus, only by elevating humans to stand on equal footing with dragons, forcing them to learn the necessity of the weak kneeling to the strong, and the meaning of their ordained path, can their capacity for violence be utterly purged.\n\n...It is an idea that has yet to come to pass. If the reaver from beyond the sky can seal off an entire planet to force humanity into their imposed order, then why might I not seal off my domain in turn? Let it become an impervious refuge. Let nothing within depart, and nothing without enter. A closed, ordered system, where life's future may be sculpted without flaw...\n\nLet this plan be named \"Xibalba,\" a title borrowed from the humans of my domain, their primitive myths whispering of an underworld. Should it succeed, neither the sovereign rulers nor the Abyssal foe shall be able to breach its sealed laws. A fitting title for an incorruptible sanctuary...\n\n...\n\nThe king's waking days grow rarer, and so too do our chances to commune with him. He approved Kemonel's plan, as well as my own.\n\nLike Kukulkan, I grow perplexed... What path may bring true joy to our Sovereign? What kind of path may allow this land to prosper for ten thousand years to come?\n\nI do not know. The Xibalba project is progressing smoothly, but even if it were progressing perfectly, I could not convince myself. If the hierarchy of power has failed to ease our Sovereign's suffering... If I cannot, by the wisdom he granted me, fathom how to truly please him... Then by what right do I dare ordain a path for all other lives?\n\nPerhaps... I need to observe the humans more, humans who have yet to be tainted by their laughable traditions.

The people there call themselves the Frostmoon Scions. According to Danil, they are adherents of the Moon Maiden, and they have an... interesting way of viewing things. For example, most of them reject the use of kuuvahki devices, believing that to use them is to abuse their deity's blessings. As such, I did not have to help them repair anything while the caravan was there, and only needed to fix our own machines.\nTo my surprise, a girl of ten or so came to look for me in secret during a break, and asked to be taught some mechanical principles. Perhaps she was concerned that she would be discovered by others, but she did not give me her name until we were leaving. She was somewhat impetuous, but she has both enthusiasm and talent, and learned the basics I taught very quickly. It's just a shame that the Frostmoon Scions will likely not let her fiddle with machines in public. I left her a few technical manuals that I got through trade with other traveling merchants (Danil initially thought that these little books could help me regain my memories). I hope she can buckle down and gain something from those texts.\n...\n\n...\nI stayed a few days more in Nasha Town this time. Come to think of it, this is the first time I've been split off from the rest of the caravan for this long. Danil and Demyan seem to go a good way back, with the latter arranging for my lodgings after only a short chat, right next to his own place to boot. I'll be inconveniencing him until Danil and the others get back from Snezhnograd, but Demyan doesn't seem to mind at all. In fact, he wound up speaking to me about machines quite a bit, starting with the origin of the name \"Papa Wrench.\" It's a bit embarrassing now that I think about it, since he clearly picked that topic just so I'd have things to say. I say, it's no wonder he's in sole charge of The Flagship here in Nasha Town despite his youth.\nDanil did ask if I wanted to join them in going to Snezhnograd, or perhaps Novokitezhgrad. After all, that's where my technical skills are from, so it's likely that I'll find my identity and past there as well. However, a nebulous unease kept me from going. I do not know what it is I fear. Perhaps it has to do with my lost memories, or with some incident I encountered... Seeing my hesitation, Danil made the call for me. He even took care of everything else, just as he has done for me all this time.\nNot that there's any point bringing up any of my unfortunate past. I don't remember them. But I will say this, that meeting Danil and the rest of the caravan was in no wise misfortune. If not for them, I would have lost my life long ago, out there on those shallows. They took me in when I had nothing, while I can do so little to repay them...\n...\n\n...\nNasha Town is home to many children, though I dare not imagine their circumstances. But then again, as with me, what they might need is neither sympathy nor pity. Indeed, just writing these two words almost seems to bring someone's arrogant face to mind. Still, I'm glad that they at least find my stories interesting — though that might be down to the candies I've brought. I learned that trick from Danil, by the by — always bring a few in your pocket \"just in case.\"\nAmongst the kids, however, there is one who is more interested in the tools I always keep at my hip than any tale about Snegurochka. When I asked if she'd like to carry one in her hand, ah, how her eyes sparkled! Katya, the Speranza's boss, takes great care of these kids for the most part, and she rather gently gave us space so that I could tell this girl, Aino, about the techniques in which I have much skill — the art of communicating with machines. It seems that just as I am lucky to have had Danil and the others take me in, these children have found a fortune that belongs to them. *sigh* Even in a world filled with such terrible tragedies, there are so many kind people...\nI quickly found that Aino is not only interested but stunningly talented at working with machines. I have taught her how to distinguish the material make of gears, calibrate pressure indicators, and adjust safety valves, and she has proven not only quicker to learn than the rest, but also capable of inferring other knowledge from such lessons.

These jellyfish are usually found near the beaches on Maroon Basin, where the shallow tidal zones make perfect hunting grounds for tiny plankton. Even after the tide recedes, they glide effortlessly on land — likely thanks to specialized water sacs that keep them moisturized, or perhaps mucus-secreting glands that minimize dehydration. Their tentacles are far tougher than a typical jellyfish's and seem to possess some unique power, though perhaps only effective against their prey. I carefully poked one with a stick, and it did not react much, nor did it attack me. (Prodding a jellyfish, ha! I dare say no one in the Conch Gang has guts like mine!) They \"communicate\" by intertwining their tentacles, like humans shaking hands or high-fiving.

Even so, I didn't have to travel far from the camp before I finally found one.\n\n...Found is the only word I can use — it certainly wasn't hunting. By the time I arrived, the goat was standing transfixed, like a deliberately posed corpse, a very ungoatly expression frozen on its face. Its eyes were cloudy and protruding outwards, puffed up like a pair of fish eyes. But it wasn't a corpse — it was alive. Until the moment I cut its chest open, its heart was pumping blood... Until the moment I slit its chest open, my blade plunging into its heart, its foul-smelling blood spraying across the ground, gleaming inky green in the moonlight... Until the moment I opened its chest, it stood there, motionless, its swollen eyes staring into space, unmoved by its impending death, as though even the peace of the grave was not its to own...\n\n...May Her Majesty the Tsaritsa forgive me.

At around midnight, the captain held a meeting in the dining room to explain the situation — there was nothing we could do for the missing passenger, so for the sake of everyone else's safety, the Fosegrin would leave these waters as soon as possible. I went back to check on the children — their cabin sits toward the center of the ship, so as long as they didn't leave, they would be safe from whatever lurked outside.\n\nPerhaps due to worry, I hardly slept a wink.

This can't be a coincidence.\nDmitriy and Kozlov come from vastly different backgrounds. Their lives and social circles have no overlap. There was no clear thread to connect them. However, upon investigating Dmitriy's associates, I discovered that when he was working as a locomotive engineer, Kozlov also served as an ordinary crew member on the same line. Clearly, Kozlov was not proud of his job, and he concealed this part of his past when he joined the Black Spruce Trading Company.\nThe two were reunited by chance during a train breakdown and, due to one's past grievances and the other's desire for power, agreed to work together. Dmitriy used his inside knowledge to manufacture a \"natural\" avalanche — staging it as a tragic accident — while Kozlov used his own tried and tested methods to lure Plekhanov to an abandoned warehouse and kill him.\nFools always believe they can cheat fate.

It's damp and smells like old tree roots. Life there was peaceful and serene before the noisy \"big guys\" dragged their metal to the gorge. When night falls and the big guys leave, the Moley family comes out from their cave and scavenges for food or frolics with the Moonglow Fireflies.\nLittle Lil' Moley loves the moon even more than Lakkaberries and Moonglow Fireflies. The moon over Moleyvalley shines big and bright like a huge white plate in the sky. (Jurva says that Sniffer Moles have poor eyesight but powerful noses and sensitive ears. Perhaps Little Lil' Moley can smell the moon, even from so far away — maybe it's as fragrant as the sweetest of Lakkaberries...) On nights when the moon is particularly bright, she can make out a few shadowless moles drifting in the moonlight, like smoke blowing in the wind. They talk to each other, but never let Little Lil' Moley join in. It's as if they can't even see her. Maybe it's because Little Lil' Moley still has her shadow. She's heard that mysterious groups have their own secret rules (like the Hollowhands) — maybe she needs to be introduced by a shadowless mole, or complete some sort of arcane ritual, before she can do more than just listen from the sidelines.\nThough, as far as Little Lil' Moley is concerned, even just listening to them speak is engrossing. One of the Sniffer Moles comes from far away. It seems he doesn't have a home, and so he can rest his head anywhere he chooses. He claims to have been to snow-capped mountains, passed through sandy deserts, climbed towering peaks, and walked along the bottom of the deepest oceans. \"Do those places have fresh Lakkaberries?\" one of the local moles asked. \"As far as I know, they don't. But they have many other delicacies.\" Upon hearing his response, the local mole scrunched up his face — it appears he likes Lakkaberries quite a lot.\nLittle Lil' Moley loves Lakkaberries too, but she also wants to know if she'll like the other delicacies the shadowless mole mentioned. She left Moleyvalley once before to go on her own adventure, burrowing into the soil for a long, long time to reach a place full of big guys. She went at night, and there was so much noise and so many lights that she could barely follow the direction of the moon. She smelled many smells there, though most of them were unpleasant. Eventually, she followed the familiar scent of Lakkaberries to a place piled high with fruit, including many types she had never seen before. They smelled delicious. She hoped she might take some with her — just a few would do — but luck wasn't shining on her that day. Sometimes that's just how things are.\nWhen she returned to Moleyvalley, she found that everyone had been worried about her. They were shocked to hear she had traveled so far away. Wasn't life in Moleyvalley perfect? Why would she want to go anywhere else? So Little Lil' Moley told them what she had heard from the shadowless moles. \"How could there be moles with no shadows? You must have been dreaming.\" Her brother, Lil' Moley, said in disbelief. He didn't approve of his little sister leaving the valley, and neither did anyone else — for them, after all, there could be no fruit in this world as delectable as fresh Lakkaberries.\nIf she didn't see the shadowless moles the next time the moon shone bright, she would accept that this was all just a dream. After all, Little Lil' Moley was perfectly content with life in Moleyvalley. But the next time that huge white plate rose in the sky, the shadowless moles rose with it, repeating their conversations from before. Since this was no dream, it must be guidance from the moon. Little Lil' Moley was overjoyed. Beneath that radiant moon, she once again set out alone, leaving Moleyvalley behind, though this time, she did not know when she would return — for who could say if she would find something even more scrumptious than fresh Lakkaberries in the snowy mountains, sandy deserts, or wherever else she might end up."},{"id":"Book1108","title":"Book1108","filename":"Book1108_EN.txt","text":"As luck would have it, a previously unrecorded ruin came upon me by chance.

The Master Thief Reed Miller and the Sampo Mill (Deluxe Quarterly Edition)\n\n(This inexpensive and entertaining story series, popular in Nasha Town, costs only 10 Mora per issue. Presumably, it's about the master thief Reed Miller's attempt to steal the Frostmoon relic, the Sampo Mill, from the governor's palace. However, in a seeming attempt to boost readership, the narrative is focusing on the many young women vying for Miller's affections instead.)\n\n...\n\nChapter IV\nWagtail, a beauty as dangerous as a hunting falcon, has appeared! She approaches master thief Reed Miller under the moonlight... but to what end?\n\n\"Leaving your lovely female companions behind to come enjoy the night view here? What a cad you are, my dear.\"\n\nThat soft voice is as smooth as the finest silk from Liyue, and yet beneath its surface lurks a subtle cruelty, sharp as the thorns of a Sumeru Rose. Reed Miller does not turn around, for he knows that voice all too well.\n\nA graceful figure lands beside him with the poise of a cat. A young woman in her twenties, with long lavender hair cascading over her pale, bare shoulders and neck. She wears an elegant silver evening gown that clings to her curves like liquid moonlight. Still, it cannot conceal the mockery in her brownish-red eyes.\n\nMeet Wagtail — or \"A,\" as she is known to a privileged few like Miller. She is the only femme fatale in Nod-Krai whose skill and infamy rival those of the most legendary thieves. Any treasure she sets her sights on is already hers; once the thrill is gone, she'll just as soon toss it to the poor in the streets as she might cast it into the sea. Countless men have vied for her affection, but she takes pleasure only in toying with their earnest feelings and has never returned the love of a suitor...\n\nThe only treasure Wagtail has been unable to steal is the heart of master thief Reed Miller. This one impossible feat drives her obsession with the handsome, enigmatic man, and she's tried every trick and gambit imaginable to make his heart hers and hers alone.\n\n\"I smell expensive perfume and cheap ambition, Wagtail.\"\n\nWith a smile on her lips, she smoothly settles down beside the thief, then almost imperceptibly sidles closer to him.\n\n\"It was a gift from another man. Jealous?\" She lets a silk-gloved hand trail down his arm. \"As for me, I smell overconfidence, Reed. You've got your eye on the Sampo Mill, I'm sure. But isn't that a little... obvious of you?\"\n\n\"You're right. I do want the Mill, which was stolen from the Frostmoon Scions, along with all the governor's other ill-gotten treasures.\" Miller finally meets Wagtail's gaze, sending an involuntary shiver running through her and a blush rising to her cheeks, which she forces down with a glib smile. \"This is my stage tonight. You'd better find your own.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\" She leans in, her lips a mere breath from his. \"This stage is big enough for two. The spotlight, however... That only shines on one. I'll have my hands on the Mill before you do, darling. And if you please me... I might even let you see it from afar.\"\n\nDing!\n\nThe words are barely out of Wagtail's mouth before she whips out a slender, sinister-looking dagger with lightning speed. She delights in the pointless and seemingly dangerous attack, knowing full well Miller will block it, and indeed he does, by simply raising his arm and deflecting her blade with his gauntlet. The clash of metal on metal lasts but a brief moment.\n\n\"Reckless as always, Wagtail. It'll cost you one of these days.\"\n\n\"Hah. Recklessness is a privilege afforded to beautiful women, don't you know? If it's not to your liking, darling, come teach me a lesson.\"\n\nLike a moonlit breeze, she takes two steps back and blows him a playful kiss. Then, she leaps into the darkness beneath the tower, leaving naught behind but the ghost of her expensive perfume in the cold night air.\n\n(The middle section of the volume has been ripped out, perhaps for a purpose other than reading...)\n\nChapter XVII\nJust as the governor is fuming over the theft of the Sampo Mill, a group of detectives from Snezhnaya suddenly swarm in and clap him in irons! Just what is...?\n\n\"Ha! Your Excellency, your fury must have overtaken you, such that you've forgotten who Reed Miller is. He is a despicable thief, yes, but is he not also a master of disguise, able to become any man, woman, or child with uncanny skill?\"\n\n\"Y—You... That's impossible! This is absurd... If you were pretending to be Leonov, the Oprichniki would surely have—\"\n\nThe man posing as Detective Leonov laughs, slowly circling the bound governor twice in a clear mockery of his pompous \"deductions.\"\n\n\"The Oprichniki? You mean the men who tied you up and sealed off this palace? Those are my people. I had them pose as Oprichniki, and your men believed it without question. Surprised, Governor? Have you forgotten how blindly Snezhnayan soldiers follow orders, whether from real superiors or clever impostors? As we speak, the Frostmoon Scions' treasure has been safely returned to their holy lady. Unless you plan to defy the Tsar's will and risk open war with the Frostmoon Scions, recovering the Sampo Mill is no longer an option for you.\"\n\n\"You... You blasted crook! You accursed thief! I could have tolerated you stealing the Mill, but must you plunder my personal collection too!?\"\n\n\"Does it matter? Those treasures you claim as yours, those lands you call your own, weren't they stolen from the destitute who live here?\" The man's demeanor remains perfectly composed, a stark contrast to the agitation written all over the governor's crimson face. \"I see no difference between a bandit who robs the people and a governor who oppresses them. We defend our freedom in the only way we can, because no one else will fight for it. But rest assured, I'm not keeping any of this. Every treasure will be returned to its rightful owner. I shall not keep even a single piece.\"\n\nAcross the room, Wagtail, posing as a detective, lets out a soft sigh inaudible to the governor.\n\n\"Oh dear, this man truly is beyond help. He speaks of laying no claim to treasure, when he holds the Frost Moon's most prized gem in his hand...\"\n\nWagtail's words stun Shadow Weasel, momentarily pulling her attention away from her adoptive father, who is bound up in the center of the room.\n\n\"Wh—When? Mr. Reed Miller should've given the Sampo Mill to that holy woman. Wait. He didn't secretly swap it for a fake while we weren't looking, did he...?\"\n\n\"Ah, you don't get it, do you? That's exactly how he deceived you young ladies.\" The woman sighs dramatically. \"What he has stolen for himself is the heart of the Frost Moon's daughter.\""},{"id":"Book1117","title":"Book1117","filename":"Book1117_EN.txt","text":"Just who is this person who so swiftly captured the heart of a young lady who didn't believe in love?\n\n(This is a popular piece of fiction in Nod-Krai that chronicles the romance between the master thief Reed Miller and the governor's daughter, Leonita Prokhorovna Trubetskaya, from their first encounter on. Disclaimer: This story is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to real persons, places, or events is purely coincidental.)\n\nThe young lady Leonita Prokhorovna Trubetskaya, the apple of the governor's eye, makes her way to the dining room with her maid in tow. Though there's a current of anxiety running beneath her calm facade, her steps are poised and graceful. After all, a lady must always appear as such, no matter what.\n\nHer eyes are fixed on the morning papers, for she's almost certain today is the day the master thief Reed Miller shall publish his notice. She might be beginning to understand the mind of this elusive raven, she thinks, and the fact that her father's men haven't even caught a glimpse of him yet has sparked a flash of anger in her. \"Hmph, I'll catch you for sure!\"\n\nHer father seems unusually absorbed in the paper today. Leonita swallows her bite of toast and asks casually,\n\"My dear Father, any interesting news today?\"\n\"Mmm, nothing that my dear little Leonita needs to worry her pretty little head about.\" Lord Trubetskoy puts down the newspaper, smiles at his daughter, and says, \"Send the jeweler in.\"\n\nA red-haired footman standing next to the governor immediately leads someone in. The latter bows deeply, a jewelry box in hand. The governor takes but a glance at it, then gestures for the box to be presented to his daughter. As a look of surprise flickers across Leonita's face, he says, \"Come now, don't tell me you thought I forgot your birthday. At the ball three days from now, my dear little Nita will be the belle of Snezhnaya — no, of the whole of Teyvat. Now, put it on so I can take a look!\"\n\nLeonita obediently takes the necklace from the box and clasps it around her neck. Her father's choice is, as always, impeccable: the design and cut are unmistakably from Fontaine, and the central gemstone is so brilliant as to outshine the finest stones from Natlan. \"I know it's a bit early,\" he says, \"but as your father, I should be the first to wish you a happy birthday, my dear!\" He casts a glance at the necklace and adds,\n\n\"Make sure you wear it to the ball. A very important guest will be there, and I want you to meet him.\"\n\nHer father is speaking in a serious tone, one that makes Leonita grasp the gift's true import immediately. She will be of age to be betrothed after this birthday. As the governor's daughter, she has always been expected to be married off to the son of some powerful Snezhnayan noble. This is why she has never believed in love. It was, after all, completely meaningless. Her father has special affection for her intelligence and beauty, of course. But more importantly, her obedience and maturity are everything he expects from an adopted daughter.\n\nOf course, that's just one of the reasons.\n\n\"I understand, dear Father.\" He ruffles her hair with a final, affectionate gesture. The fatherly smile vanishes from his face as he returns to his formidable role as governor, his full attention now back on his duties.\n\nLeonita watches her father leave with a gentle pang in her heart. She composes herself after a soft exhale, for it's time to focus. She picks up the morning paper, and there on the front page, just as she expected, is a letter adorned with black feathers. It reads:\n\nDear Lord Trubetskoy,\nThree nights from now, on the dark night of the new moon, your treasure will be mine.\n\nI thank you for your kind generosity. With the greatest regard,\nReed Miller.\n\n====================\n\"Tell me, can you tell which of us is which?\"\nThe jeweler from Fontaine stares in surprise as two red-haired footmen emerge from the dressing room. Of course, only one of them ranks as a Footman, Second Class from the governor's palace.\n\"Left... no, wait. Right? No, that can't be it... I mean... right! Yes, the right one is right!\"\n\"Are you just taking a guess?\" The man on the right seems a tad displeased.\n\"Are you sure about that? If you're wrong, you'll be in trouble tonight!\" the footman on the left teases.\n\"Right is right!\" A firm reply, but one betrayed by a copiously sweating face.\nThe footman on the right bursts out laughing, then shoves his double toward the jeweler. \"You're wrong,\" he says. \"This one here is your sweetheart!\"\n\"Ha! Our disguise is impeccable!\"\n\"Uh... I—I meant the one on the right is the fake!\"\n\"You...!\"\n\"Hahaha, you two!\" Reed Miller, disguised as a footman, interjects, his laughter filling the room. \"Don't forget, our goal is to make the fake look real! If even a lover cannot recognize their beloved, tonight's operation is bound to go off without a hitch.\"\n\"But is it wise for you to do this alone? If anything goes wrong, you won't have anyone to fall back on,\" the real footman points out, his voice filled with concern.\n\"I won't lose any more of my Treasure Hoarders,\" Reed Miller says, the mirth gone from his face. \"You've already completed the most dangerous task, which is to infiltrate the governor's palace. So don't worry about me and go back to Fontaine. The people there need the Treasure Hoarders' help, too.\"\nThe footman and the jeweler exchange a glance. Then, they swear solemnly to Reed Miller: \"We promise to steal all the misery from this world!\"\n\nMiller watches the two leave, then turns toward the governor's palace, bathed in the setting sun. Trubetskoy had been successful against the Treasure Hoarders for one simple reason: his immense wealth. Even the world's greatest thieves have been powerless before his near-limitless resources. With enough treasure, one could hire the finest warriors, acquire the best weapons, and surround oneself with the shrewdest advisors. Wealth could even silence the law and bury all resistance beneath a grave of golden sand.\n\nThe true extent of Trubetskoy's wealth has been a mystery to the world. More oddly, no one has ever seriously questioned its source either. A chuckle escapes Miller's lips at the thought. But now, he holds the answer: the legendary Sampo Mill, a magical relic said to generate endless riches, is hidden within the governor's palace itself. For this discovery, he has the red-haired footman's investigation, the jeweler's keen eye, and the governor's daughter (whose birthday was fast approaching) to thank...\n\n====================\nThe newspaper with Miller's letter sells out almost instantly. In the days that follow, all of Nod-Krai is abuzz with anticipation for Leonita's birthday ball... albeit not for the governor's daughter herself, but for the inevitable clash between the master thief and the governor.\n\nThe governor's palace has been put on high alert, with every arriving guest subjected to intense scrutiny. This is a necessary precaution given the master thief's known skill for disguise. As Leonita scans the long list of names and titles — barons, sons of earls, rising stars in the royal court, clans favored by the Tsar, and so on — the necklace around her neck begins to feel heavy, less like a gift and more like a set of shackles.\n\nSome fresh air out in the courtyard would be good right now, she thinks.\n\n\"Mama, is that the daughter of Lord Trubetskoy?\"\n\"Indeed, she is.\"\n\"But why is she... human? I mean, the Honorable Lord isn't.\"\n\"She's just the Lord's adoptive daughter.\"\n\"How utterly strange. Why would the noble Lord Trubetskoy adopt a human...?\"\n\nA poised and elegant lady, whom Leonita has never seen before, is whispering to her child in a nearby hallway. When she notices Leonita looking, she turns away and leaves without a word.\n\nThat's true. Why in the world would the noble Lord Trubetskoy adopt a human being?\n\"That's true! Why in the world would the noble Lord Trubetskoy adopt a human being?\"\n\nA whisper, speaking of the unhappiness creeping into her heart, startles Leonita. She looks around the courtyard, but she is alone. Is her imagination playing tricks on her? She sighs and turns toward the palace's innermost chambers for another round of treatment. These sessions leave her utterly drained, yet she endures them without a word of complaint, so determined is she never to be a source of shame for her father.\n\nFor some reason, she recalls the voice she had just heard in the courtyard.\n\nIt was a voice that, like a bonfire in winter, radiated heat that could melt the snow.\n\n====================\nAs night falls, guests begin to arrive one after another. Leonita feels her nervousness grow. All evening, she is approached by a stream of potential partners, each asking for a dance. But as they come and go, not a single name registers in her mind.\n\n\"Ten, nine, eight...\" The countdown to midnight begins, and every eye in the room turns eagerly to her. Beside her father, the ambitious upstart from the royal court stands, his gaze fixed on her — or perhaps on the massive gem gleaming at her neck. \"Six, five, four...\" She can't tell what everyone is anticipating: is it her birthday, or is it something else entirely...?\n\n\"...Three, two—\"\n\nHuh...? Since moments ago, Leonita has noticed that everyone around her seems enveloped in a silvery-white glow, and this light has only grown brighter since. From time to time, her own body would emit the same silvery-white light. Her father calls it a disease that requires constant treatment — a flaw in her very being.\n\n\"...ONE!\" The jewel on her neck suddenly drops with a whoosh.\n\nThe world is engulfed in a silvery-white light. Around Leonita, a silence as deep as a snowy night falls. She stands frozen, her pulse beating in rhythm with the light and her heart pulled by an invisible thread. There's a part of her that is screaming to run, but a gentle restraint holds her feet. What is this? Magic? Fate? Or is it the feeling she's never believed in, flaring to life the moment it comes near? The crowd around her melts away as time seems to stop, and from the stillness, a flash of warm red bolts toward her.\n\n\"Miss Leonita, you're in danger! The governor has instructed me to protect you. Please, follow me.\"\n\"But Father told me to... no. No, he didn't send you. You're... Reed Miller!\"\n\"Please, Miss. This was a last-minute order by—\"\n\"Everyone calls you clever, but in my opinion, you're nothing but a shameless liar!\"\n\"...Well, well. Isn't someone a sharp young Miss?\"\n\"Hmph. Father has set a tight net. You're not getting out of here.\"\n\"But that 'tight net' is centered on the Sampo Mill in the secret chamber, isn't it?\"\n\"Ugh...\"\n\"I made it clear in the notice: Tonight, the governor's most prized treasure will be mine.

But like a person who has never loved and thus insists love isn't real, those who find this story implausible only do so because they have never experienced such a moment themselves."},{"id":"Book1118","title":"Book1118","filename":"Book1118_EN.txt","text":"Little is known about Zima, who hailed from Snezhnaya, a land of perpetual winter. His name is found in no logbook, no epic, no heroic tale. Like a single snowflake, he briefly brushed against the surface of legend before disappearing without a trace.\n\nZima came from a small town southeast of Snezhnograd, where villagers harvested ice beneath the snow-capped mountain peaks. On snowy nights, they called forth tales and skeins, like primeval airs sealed beneath the ice — of mischievous frost spirits who stole travelers' boots and pale, melancholy Snegurochka who, when betrayed, froze the lovers they had once sought into lifelike statues by ripping the very warmth from them. Zima had seen a strange, deranged smile on a companion who fell for a Snegurochka before, and he found it a monotonous way to die. He abhorred following a pattern, even the pattern of an unusual death. Instead, he longed for a unique fate and a life of adventure, and so he left the land of eternal white for the blue seas of the archipelago to the south. It was there that he first heard of the legendary master thief.\n\nThe name Reed Miller was already well-known across Nod-Krai. Stories claimed he had been captured by the governor and taken to Snezhnograd for a hanging on the public square. But just as everyone believed his story would end with a swaying corpse, the governor's vault was found emptied with a taunting message etched in gold dust on the wall. No one knew how he had escaped the noose, but his miraculous return turned him into a tavern legend and an idol to the youth. So when the master thief reappears, buys a three-masted ship, and starts recruiting sailors seeking adventure and fortune at the harbor, Zima offers his name without a second thought.\n\nLife aboard the ship, however, turns out to be far less heroic than the legends promised. Though famed for robbing the rich, Miller runs his operation with the meticulous care of a spice merchant — his nautical charts are cluttered not only with markings for reefs and currents but also red-circled warnings for waters said to harbor sea monsters. He spends days skirting around those regions, avoiding the dark abysses where dangerous creatures lurk as well as the serpent-infested Sea of Mist. Day-to-day life has been a grind of scrubbing decks, patching sails, and scurvy gums. For Zima, it all feels too familiar, too safe, too dull. At night, he prays to the inky sea for a real storm, or for some monstrous kraken to rise from the depths. He longs to see the master thief drive a harpoon into a creature's eye, just like the heroes of old. More than anything, he craves an adventure that would truly stir his soul.\n\nHis prayers are answered, albeit in a cruel and twisted way. Drifting into a calm, azure sea, the ship is met with a strange, inhuman song. Though it has no melody, its power ensnares even the most drunken sailors. The sails drop, and the ship stalls. From the water, a pale, hauntingly beautiful face emerges. It is a siren, and she demands a sacrifice in exchange for safe passage. The ship is given a choice: make a sacrifice, or be dragged to the depths.\n\nReed Miller flatly refuses to make the sacrifice. Instead, he orders everyone aboard to plug their ears with beeswax to block out the siren's haunting song. But it is futile. Even reason and willpower bend beneath the weight of legend. Seized by panic and the deadly song, the sailors hurl the crates of Mora looted from the governor's palace overboard, thinking the gold might serve as payment. But the siren pays the shimmering discs that have scattered and sank into the azure deep no heed, for human wealth means nothing to her. Her covetous gaze remains only on the sailors themselves.\n\nThe master thief, whose neck not even the hangman's noose could restrain, now has no choice but to acquiesce. Miller places his scimitar coldly at Zima's throat, but Zima does not resist. This is the moment he has traveled so far for. As the icy waters rise above his head, the face of his long-lost friend appears before him, frozen in sculpture, still wearing that faint, familiar, ecstatic smile sealed by the Snegurochka's kiss. All his life, Zima has abhorred following a pattern, running from every known ending, only to realize in this final moment that every escape has been a flight into another mirror. His adventures did not pen a new story... They were merely unnoticed footnotes to an existing one."},{"id":"Book1119","title":"Book1119","filename":"Book1119_EN.txt","text":"Proem\nO lips, now voice a solemn hymn for me, to speak the North's old warnings, low and high.\nI've left my land, my native shores, departed home and wandered far...\nThrough realms unknown, where none know my name, across a barren land long lost to fame...\nBleak tundras find rest in deep water's wake, only snow dances upon a thousand lakes.\nYet still the moonlight bathes the path I trace, and winds still brush the sorrow from my face.\nLet me sing of how the moon first kissed the land, let me chant the verse that drives back evil bands.\nI praise the rivers raging strong, and praise the peaks that range ever on.\nI praise the bronze-bound ship of Seutervoinen, and the golden arrows of Ianikuinen unbroken.\nI curse the poisonous plot of Pakkaisukko, and decry Pohjola's calamity forever more.\nMy prayer, a sacred word from Heaven above, sang to my forebears by envoys beloved.\nBut fate is in the end like a fleeting dream, and death, like waters clear, drowns every eye.\nSo long as moonlight hangs in its prison on high, I cannot return to home beloved, even if it be nigh.\nWhere golden light soft through verdant crown shines, where dawnstars in silver array the pines.\nO heirs of Hyperborea, mark this song, etch it in your minds fast and strong.\nSeek not to tread the sly fox-paths slight, nor yearn for the great bear's haughty might.\nBut so long as hymn and Runo ring, the far North shall endure and eternal spring.\n\nPrayer Song I: Pitkamoonen, Lord of the Seven Calamities\n(The summer solstice.

In its place, one who is ranked Assistant Priestess or higher is to recite \"May the new moon illuminate your path\" instead. This is meant to invoke protection for the child from the taint of the sublunary sphere.)\n\nPrayer Song III: Tuonetar, Mother of the Underworld\n(During the autumn harvest, animal sacrifices are offered in accordance with the social status of those who died that year. The prepared animals are placed in intricately carved wooden or bronze vessels, shaped like boats, to be burned. Before the burning, a clergy member of Assistant Priestess rank or higher removes the eyes of each animal and presents them separately to the mistress of the underworld. With eyes veiled by a dark cloth, the Archpriestess then chants the Runo four times and performs divination using animal entrails to please the deity.)\n\nO Mistress of the dead, slow to be moved and without expression,\nO shadowy lady of the underworld — somber, taciturn, fearsome Tuonetar!\nYou abhor the arrogant and the disrespectful, and from your grasp, there is no escape.\nYour feet have trod both the humble hut and the gilded throne.\nThe people fear you, for you see all, hear all, and judge all.\nWe revere you for your boundless grace and all-embracing nature.\nThe fate of all living beings rests solely in your hands, and you remain unmoved no matter how fervent the plea.\nYet noble and majestic goddess, we know that gentleness and mercy are your first nature.\nJust as you granted our ancestors liberation from suffering and extended it not,\nO mistress of death, you who know the fates of all under the moon, accept our humble offering.\nThe descendants of the far north beseech you, now that the golden bloodline has returned to your bosom,\nThat you lead us across the nether's dark stream, and let us sleep eternal in a dreamless dream.\n\n(Note From Priestess Ehrnrooth: This ritual was abolished by decree of Aila, the first Moonchanter, five centuries ago. Now, when a aherent of the Frost Moon dies, regardless of social status, an Assistant Priestess, or someone of higher rank, is to recite instead \"May the new moon lead you to the shore of peace.\" A simple and solemn funeral is then conducted.)\n\nPrayer Song IV: Laimelea, Mother of Time\n(On the Winter Solstice, a cloth bearing the year's significant events is burned, and its ashes are gathered in a silver cup filled with pure water. The Archpriestess chants the Runo four times, and when the wind begins to stir, they anoint the Verdant Crest with the blessed mixture to honor the divinity.)\n\nO pure and eternal Mother of Time, sovereign who was never born and who shall never die,\nYou create all and destroy all.

Stranger still, kuuvahki-filled moss grows all over it, glowing like stars in the dark cave. Who knows, maybe that's the Crab Tsar's crown.\nGiven all that, it makes perfect sense that the smaller crabs nearby have ended up as his subjects. Poor little things, they are always scurrying around, dragging food like Lakkaberries, tiny fish, and all sorts of other stuff I can't even name into the cave's depths, instead of just enjoying it right there and then. Twice, I even saw them hauling back shiny pebbles and bits of Moonfall Silver. Maybe that's the \"tax\" they owe the Tsar.

Then, this tiny crab came scuttling over, dragging the saddest little fish you ever saw right up to its feet. The Tsar just lowered its head, gave it a glance, and casually waved one of its massive pincers. The poor, panicky little crab immediately dropped that fish, then scurried straight back into the sand.\nThe Tsar didn't eat the fish. It just nudged the fish aside with a smaller claw, then lay still, staring out toward the sea — or at least, that's what it looked like to me. I'm telling you, being a king must be lonely. All the other crabs are scared of him. It may have a fortress and maybe even a crown, but it has no friends he can reach out to with his claws, not like the Tassel Jelly can with its tentacles.

The priest who led the project, Vinda of Hithamthrausa, has passed beyond, and the essential Tekhneikos processes and Mekhaneikos apparatuses required for its continuation were lost in the fall of Hyperborea. These include, but are not limited to:\n· The process of [...] cutting and modification;\n· The process of [...] creation and reconstruction;\n· The [...] and [...] processes, which were of the fae;\n· The adaptive [...] editing process;\n· ...\nThe aforementioned Tekhneikos processes are, at present, irreproducible.\n\nAfter due deliberation, the following alternative protocol has been deemed acceptable:\n· The purification of existing [...] is to be performed through controlled artificial selection, using methods primitive and inefficient.\n· The phenotypic stability of each generation shall be recorded. Then, from this data, the most suitable pairs for union shall be identified, and non-coercive means employed to persuade the parties to join in union.\n· Should persuasion fail to meet the criteria detailed in Tekhneikos Manual O-90, promptly proceed to the next priority match, and continue in like fashion.\n· To minimize risk of disease, the Bloodline Proximity Index of all breeding pairs shall not exceed [...]. Accordingly, no individuals shall be joined in union if they share common ancestry within five generations.\n\nThis course of action is expected to yield outcomes approaching the original objective after [...] successive generations of refinement and selection. At such time, the one prophesied, the newborn Sacred Heir, shall arise. Without the need for ritual implements, nor the forfeiture of their soul, this heir shall command the pure, unaltered elemental forces at will, and shall at last attain fusion with the World.\n\nNote: In light of projected population growth and the limits of environmental carrying capacity, it is anticipated that the practice of widespread artificial breeding may be terminated after seven generations. Thereafter, limited intermarriage with select outlanders may then be sanctioned (details in Tekhneikos Manual I-1012). Furthermore, it is hereby affirmed that, once the continuity of civilization has been assured, the descendants of the far north shall be granted the sovereign right to determine their own destinies.\n\n...\nProtocol VI: The Subatomic Assembling Mass-Energy Patterning Orb (Sealed)\nThe project of constructing this supremely advanced Mekhaneikos construct was personally overseen by [...] and is not fully understood at this time. It was designed to reconstruct matter at the subatomic scale, or to transmute matter directly into stable energy, which would then be released in the form of [...].\n\nOf all the known highest-tier Mekhaneikos constructs dating to the time of Hyperborea, only the Subatomic Assembling Mass-energy Patterning Orb (hereafter referred to as the \"SAMPO\") has endured to the present age. Its structure remains largely intact, granting it immense symbolic significance. However, a formal evaluation by the Acting Archpriestess and the Senior Executive Mekhaneikos Priestess has determined that the device, in its current state, is no longer functional. The collaborative control module connected to the device was lost during the fall of Hyperborea and cannot be replicated with existing technologies. In the absence of this module, proper activation of the SAMPO is impossible, and it is presumed that even a forced restart would fail to correctly reconfigure said device (refer to appendix for more details).\n\nAfter due deliberation, it is resolved that the device shall be sealed indefinitely, with no re-evaluation of its activation viability for a period of [...] generations. All personnel without explicit authorization from the Archpriestess may not breach the seal. This will prevent unnecessary accidental damage to the device.\n\nNote: The Senior Executive Mekhaneikos Priestess, Ariapeithea of Massagetae, has proposed a theoretically viable bypass protocol. Namely, the controlled input of [...] Realm Energy or [...] Realm Energy (refer to Mekhaneikos Manual D-503 for the possibility of the latter) at a specific carrier frequency, which may circumvent the collaborative control module and forcibly initiate the SAMPO. Upon formal evaluation, however, the proposed method was determined to pose unacceptable safety risks, with the probability of system destabilization and ensuing [...] exceeding [...]. In light of these findings, the original decision shall stand.\n\n...\nProtocol X: The Arrow of Terpikeraunas\nThe subject of the project is a low-tier Mekhaneikos device of the Hyperborea era, designed to solidify [...] Realm Energy into a semi-crystalline polymeric form. Once stabilized, the material is subjected to a high-frequency [...] spiral acceleration and subsequently launched, thereby purging a designated area of [...] Realm Energy contamination.\n\nThe Acting Archpriestess and the Senior Executive Mekhaneikos Priestess have jointly affirmed that the device's remanufacture is viable. This work shall proceed under the oversight of Senior Executive Mekhaneikos Priestess Ariapeithea of Massagetae, with the prototype device projected for completion within [...] standard quarters.\n\nUpon completion, the prototype apparatus shall be subject to regular lubrication with ointments to prevent avoidable safety incidents.

He would believe even the most absurd lies spun by the clumsiest of charlatans, giving away his Mora and even shedding tears of pity in the process. It was said that even the most primitive of desertfolk were wiser than he.\nEveryone thought Ortba a fool, but no one knew why. They would laugh and say he was an idiot, a man so hopeless he could earn no living nor make a name for himself.\nBut Ortba's parents and the friends who truly understood him did not care about what the others said.

A kind friend helped Ortba find a job leading a mule. The work was hard and the wages were meager, a burden few could bear for more than a few days. But Ortba took to it with a happy heart, for the mule, with a scar upon its ear, was more genuine and true than anyone else in the whole bazaar. When hunger stirred within it, it would whinny and gently nudge him with its head. Then, when it had its fill of feed, it would close its eyes, lay its head in Ortba's lap, and nicker softly.

So vile was he that even the scorpions of the desert kept their distance.\nIt was on a day when Ortba and his mule were carrying goods from the desert that the swindler saw his chance. He followed them quietly from a distance and waited for Ortba to finish his work.\n\nBefore he returned to the city, Ortba decided to rest for a while at an oasis.\n\nThe swindler pounced when Ortba wandered off to pick some fruit. He crept over and stealthily slipped the lead rope from around the mule's neck, allowing an accomplice to lead the beast away. The swindler then placed the rope around his own head, crouched low to the ground in the mule's place, and waited for Ortba to return.\n\nOrtba, fruit in hand, stopped and stared at the swindler in shock. \"Oh? Who are you!?\" he exclaimed, knowing at once that the man crouching before him was certainly not his four-legged friend.\n\n\"I am a swindler,\" the crook confessed, his voice thick with feigned sobs. \"I was a man without a single moral in his bones, a wretch wicked and despicable.\"\n\"To make money, I told countless lies, caused harm to countless people, and even deceived my own mother.\"\n\"To punish me, my mother went into the desert and, with her very own tears, pleaded with Al-Ahmar to teach me how to be good.\"\n\"So, Al-Ahmar turned me into a mule to silence me and make me pay for my foul deeds through my actions instead. I would only become a human again when I learned how to be a truly good person.\"\n\nOrtba listened to the swindler's lies. As the swindler wept crocodile tears, Ortba shed real ones of his own.\n\"How sad! But you've turned back into a human, so you must now be a good man!\"\n\nOrtba jumped up with delight and took the swindler's hands in his own. He then placed all the fruit he was carrying into the swindler's hands.\n\n\"You are my friend. I have watched you drink with your head in my lap and sleep by my side. I have love for you, and it makes my heart happy that you have become a truly good person.\"\n\"Go back to your mother. I am sure she still loves you and is shedding tears for you right now. Go back, and take this fruit with you. She'll be so happy to see you!\"\n\nHolding the fruit in his hands, the swindler felt his throat, which had told countless lies and other foul things, choke up with sand. But he simply nodded his head and, in his mind, told himself:\n\"What a fool, what a fool... Only a complete fool would be taken in like that.\"\n\nOnce the swindler had gone, Ortba picked up the rope — his heart filled with joy. He ran back to the city, eager to share the story of his mule with his friends.\nOne of Ortba's friends, a mercenary, turned crimson with rage as he listened to this tale. The powerfully built man sprang to his feet, his hand flashing to the hilt of his sword, as he exploded:\n\"That stinking lowlife! He fooled you! He took advantage of your kindness for a few coins!\"\n\"Tell me his name! I'll tear that rat's tongue out myself so he can never lie to another good man like you!\"\nDespite his friend's indignant fury, the smile never left Ortba's face. He gently guided the mercenary's hand from the hilt of his sword to his cup, which he then filled with mead.\n\"I am moved that you are angry for my sake. But the way I see it, what happened was a good thing...\"\n\"If his words are true, then there is one less villain in this world to be punished. And in his place, there is one more person who has learned the meaning of repentance and regained their morals.\"\n\"If what he said was a lie, then there is one less person in this world who would cheat his own mother. And one less tearful mother who had no choice but to curse her child.\"\nAnother friend, who had already built a reputation for himself at the Akademiya, interjected:\n\"Ortba, I admire your kindness. It is a wisdom that humanity so grievously lacks, yet holds in the deepest contempt.\"\n\"But the wicked must be held to account, lest the virtuous be exploited with impunity...\"\n\"While I believe this swindler should first face due judgment... Principles be damned! He has committed a grave affront against my friend, and for that alone, he deserves to be lashed!\"\nSensing his friends' frustration, Ortba paused. He raised the jug of mead and filled his friends' cups, but his fiercely loyal friends remained silent. Their brows were furrowed as if a whirlwind of sand and dust was swirling around them, carving countless ravines and valleys from their features.\nThen suddenly, another friend burst through the door of the tavern, shouting,\n\"Hey! I just saw that mule with the scar on its ear! It's right there in the bazaar!\"\nHearing this, the mercenary gulped down his mead in one go, then shouted:\n\"Alright! It looks like the rat has left a trail. If we follow it, we're bound to catch him!\"\n\nOrtba, his friends by his side, rushed to the bazaar. And sure enough, there stood the mule, right in the middle of the marketplace. Ortba was filled with shock, and he ran toward the creature as if he had something to say.\nThe mercenary was already asking around for the mule's seller. But the scholar, who knew all too well what Ortba was like, held onto his sleeve gently, trying to stop him from doing anything too strange, like talking to the mule.\nBut Ortba softly patted the scholar's hand, then bent over nonetheless to whisper:\n\"Why have you become a mule again? Did you lie to your mother and break her heart once more?\"\n\"You'll have a hard time with someone else. Listen, I'll buy you back and take you with me.\"\n\"Don't say a word until then. Otherwise, I may not be able to pay your price.\"\nJust as Ortba was counting the Mora in his pocket, a hand came to rest on his shoulder. The hand belonged to a man with tanned skin and eyes like pure gold. He gave a slight squint as he said gently:\n\"I am the owner of this mule. Do you want to buy it?\"\n\"Yes, I want to buy it. He is my friend. In fact, he...\" Ortba looked down and stopped himself from telling the rest of the story. He believed the man would not want the world to know what he had done.\n\"I can't sell it to you right now. Besides...\"\nThe man reached for another rope from behind him and handed it over to Ortba.\n\"This is your faithful friend, my dear Ortba. Take it home with you.\"\nOrtba stared at the animal in surprise. It had a scar on its ear, just like the first one. The mule, recognizing its longtime companion, nudged Ortba with its head, and Ortba responded by ruffling its mane. But what...\n\"This mule looks just like my friend,\" said the astonished Ortba, wondering how one man could have turned into two mules, and just what grave sin he must have committed to receive such punishment.\n\"Yes, he's also your friend,\" said the tanned man with a smile, \"But he has committed a crime. So I am punishing him by turning him into a dumb mule so that he may never speak again.\"\nOrtba blinked for a moment and realized who the man with the rope was. But his thoughts were only of the friend he had once rescued, who was now on the wrong path again.\n\"But what crime did he commit? Did he lie to his mother again?\" Ortba asked sadly.\n\"No, but the crime he committed is a hundred times greater than that,\" the man answered. \"He betrayed a rare kindness, and so he shall never be saved by another's kindness again.\"\nOrtba had more questions, but before he could ask them, his vision was obscured by a sandstorm that came out of nowhere. When it cleared, the man was gone, but in his place were his friends who had found their way to him and were now asking where the swindler had gone.\nOrtba told them sadly, \"He made another mistake and was turned into a mule. I hope this time, he will have another chance to turn a new leaf.\"\nWith the rope in his hand, Ortba turned for home alongside his friends. Along the way, he thought.\n\"I need to make more money. Goodness knows how much I'll need to buy him the next time I see him.\"\n\n"},{"id":"Book1138","title":"Book1138","filename":"Book1138_EN.txt","text":"...That poor (unidentifiable)... like with the other injured adventurers, he had a severe wound on his jaw... hospitality...\n\n...He confessed to me about the caravan, hoping to retreat from society under my tutelage...

Maybe taming isn't the right word? Maybe the other engineers will look down on me for using it. But it really did feel like taming... I know modern clockwork machines well enough, so I can see the huge technological gulf between the two. Even disregarding construction, we will make little meaningful progress if we do not resolve the power issue...\n...But I still have to be careful.

Alain came to visit me, and even brought his sister! She's a lovely little lady, and unafraid of strangers. A fine day indeed...\n...We discussed the idea of a thinking machine based on gems and tape circuits. I used the word \"discussed,\" but actually, I just said things like \"Oh!\" or \"That's really amazing\" or \"How will you do that?\" whenever he paused, and didn't make any real contributions. He was really into it, though, and he behaved very differently than he usually does in the lab. His little sister is probably way smarter than I, a research assistant!\n...It seems there are interesting upsides to having my disease flare up, but I'd prefer to return to the Institute and help as soon as I can...\n\n...\n...The additional machines got here.

I helped to compile the report, but there's so much I couldn't understand!\n...Apparently, lots of people are secretly unhappy that Alain is getting more research resources than they are... But if you ask me, everyone's smarter than me, and they should all get along.

I brought a Kamera from the Institute to take photos for them. I do hope we'll have more outings like this one, especially since that means more opportunities to take photos of his sister. After all, Alain is always working. Given how he will not be with his sister as she grows up, these photos will come in handy later when he begins to regret not spending more time with her. Then he'll be able to see how she was at different times, and it won't sting quite so much! If only my family had enough money for a Kamera... and if only things hadn't gone so wrong. I'm sure my mom would have taken lots of photos of me... Rene and Jakob like Alain's sister a lot, too. When the four of them hang out, she sometimes acts like an older sister to them, despite being the youngest. A fascinating dynamic...\n...Seem to be interested in the ruins and the stone statues here. Rene also mentioned something about a troupe and seals... Even though we went out there to have a bit of fun for once, they were still thinking about research...\nNo obvious symptoms.\n\n...\nTook the day off.\n\n...\n...Alain's sister came to see me, along with Jakob.

I'm so happy that they were able to find each other again. I wonder how my friends are doing. They're probably trying to rebuild the Narzissenkreuz Institute! I've got to go check it out next time...\n...Talked about the thinking machine again. I had an idea about making a thinking Kamera, so that it would take photos of those precious to him while he's busy. He thought it was kind of pointless, but that it had security and surveillance applications...\n\n...\n...They did it! The light bulb came on! I was lucky to have recovered in time to witness this historical moment... It's quite a pity, but I hope Rene and Jakob will make the breakthroughs of their own in their own research topics! Ah, I also hope they get better assistants than me!\nNo obvious symptoms.\n\n...\nTook the day off.\n\n...\nThere were several visits while I was unconscious.

For a time afterwards, I documented the experimental procedures and phenomena based on his oral descriptions while standing here for the first time.

Rene and Jakob later entered through that door, and Alain would temporarily forget to act the young genius, rushing towards them like an energetic kid.\nHere I bore witness to the first successful controlled annihilation reaction. The brilliant light cast a deep, dark shadow, and I believe history was made in that moment. Will someone like me, so excited I knocked over the ink bottle, play a role in an event that will go down in history?\nBehind the locked door on the other side is Rene and Jakob's lab. It seems access was limited due to the dangerous nature of their research. They are destined to become towering figures in history.\nI guess Alain moved to another lab. Based on his plan, once the energy problem was solved, he would study kinematics. I'll go greet him later. I wonder how Ann is doing now?

Humans are neither wise enough to predict the future nor able to stop unfortunate accidents from occurring. It's a shame. There's nothing more to say.\"\n— Alain Guillotin, in response to a question about his early years from Nellie Cochran, Chief Editor of The Steambird\n\nAfter retiring from the Fontaine Research Institute, Guillotin declined all invitations from the Palais Mermonia and civic organizations from the Court of Fontaine. Instead, he withdrew to the Beryl Region countryside, living in near-total isolation from society — notwithstanding, even prior to this, the reclusive old man had never formed any deep connections with others. If we were to take Madame Nellie Cochran at her word, then Alain Guillotin was, at heart, a lonely shut-in, always burdened by a profound sense of insecurity. It was for this reason that he maintained a detached attitude toward others, as if by pretending to be unperceptive, he could hide the keen sensitivity of his spirit. He could not ease his own pain, nor share it with anyone; all he could do was enclose it like a pearl within the shell of his heart, shaping and polishing it with his very flesh and blood. Of course, Guillotin's students would not accept such claims, dismissing them as attention-seeking nonsense and nothing more than a smear on their master's reputation. This was the main reason why Rogier Cotes, the third director of the Fontaine Research Institute, filed a lawsuit against The Steambird...\n\nHe never employed any servants to tend to his daily needs. There were rumors that, in his youth, he had created a mechanical device capable of independent thought and had used it to assist him in his work with Mary-Ann Guillotin at the Marechaussee Phantom. As a result, he had no need for servants — he only needed to create more of the same device. However, such claims were clearly at odds with the facts: the personal effects that Guillotin left behind after his death include nothing of this nature, and so-called \"mechanical devices capable of independent thought\" are entirely inconsistent with the ideas he expressed in his manuscripts. As he wrote in Hierarchical Calculating Machines and Intelligence,\n\n\"...The real question isn't whether machines can think, but whether humans can...\" (Fontaine Natural Philosophy and Engineering Science Press, 3rd ed., Section 13, p. 5.)\n\nWe have every reason to believe that whatever contraptions Guillotin crafted in his workshop in his later years were deliberately destroyed long ago.

There was a symmetrical pattern between the time, space, and even the first letters of the four victims' names,\" Hurlock said. \"This is also why Gina's deduction was completely off the mark.

It was pure coincidence! He only wanted to kill those three unfortunate gentlemen to avenge his comrades from the Liliacruces Ordo. But the traps he set weren't limited to just those three locations. He was worried that the plan might fail, since the three victims were all well-protected figures, after all. So, he added a few extra traps.

To suggest that those mechanisms were merely activated by Mr. Marcello's mishandling seemed a bit too contrived. But to imply that there was another mastermind behind it all felt like stretching into the territory of conspiracy theories. After all, no one besides us could've pulled off the operation I envisioned. So, I decided to abandon further speculation, choosing instead to enjoy the reactions of the adorable Agent Gina.\n\n\"Hehe, this is why you don't understand deduction!\" Agent Gina seemed to have regained her confidence — not to mention her mild sense of superiority — over me.

Please consider this letter my most formal request.\n\nAfter months of controlled experiments, we have confirmed that the Experimental Plants demonstrate exceptional efficacy in processing high concentrations of Abyss corruption and (...) waste materials. In Experimental Site No. 2, the specimen successfully blocked all Abyssal corruption originating from outside the bunker within a short time frame, <color=#00E1FFFF>reflecting</color> it in a pure (...) form, thereby efficiently eliminating the monsters that had previously been extremely difficult to deal with. There is no doubt that this is an unprecedented breakthrough. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity you have given us. This success is as much yours as it is ours.\n\nHowever, I must also report the significant latent risks associated with such experiments. As I have repeatedly emphasized before, potential scenarios in which apocalyptic contamination could be released, and incidents of personnel casualties resulting from the escape of Abyssal monsters are all beyond the scope of our ability for subjective control. Among the most recent victims was even a child under (...) years old.\n\nI am fully aware that Payva's death from illness was in no way a tragedy you wished to witness, and that you exerted every effort to save that child. However, as long as experiments of this nature continue to advance, the risk of contamination leakage will only grow more severe. Our responsibility is to erect a barrier that shields humanity from catastrophe; under no circumstances should we seek to test the limits of that darkness. Forgive my bluntness, but the continuation of these experiments has become entirely meaningless — unless your intention (if I may speak frankly) is simply to permit even more otherworldly entities to pour into our bunker.\n\nBased on the aforementioned reasons, and on behalf of the research team, I hereby submit the following request:\n\nImmediately cease all further testing of the purification system.\nThoroughly eliminate all Abyssal live experimental specimens in our custody.

So many innocent people died because of my foolishness, all for a lie that he didn't even believe himself.\n\nI don't know who Rotwang is, and I don't know what kind of wretched plans they had. Nor do I want to know. All I know is that their blood is on my hands as well — simply because I believed their lies, because I trusted that they could truly offer a final refuge for good people.\n\nWhy didn't I realize it? When the pipelines were first added, I should have seen that they could just as easily be used to carry the Abyss's corruption, allowing Morozov to fabricate the illusion that The Outside World had long since been utterly destroyed by the Abyss.\n\nBut I didn't think of that.\n\nCountless people, countless people who believed in me... No matter what Brahe Reed Miller says...\n\nThey all died because of me.\n\nBrahe Reed Miller said that the Abyssal corruption here cannot be eliminated overnight, and Morozov, like Rotwang, would one day be resurrected as a mindless monster despite having lost all sanity and humanity, until the hero prophesied by the Frostmoon Scions' Moonchanter (What is this? Don't those strange people only have an archpriestess?) destroys it completely. Until then, it will forever wander these Abyss-corroded ruins, devouring the flesh and blood of those who stray in here.\n\nI can't turn off the bunker broadcast signal he left behind, nor can I close the bunker gates that he left permanently open. Directly destroying this place would cause the Abyss corruption to spread, so I can only pray that no one will ever set foot here again.\n\nSo, I declined his offer to take me away, choosing instead to stay behind.

When he asked why I hadn’t named them, I thought about it and realized I didn’t know myself. Perhaps I simply couldn’t bring myself to confront the truth of our experiments. In response, he said that he, a master thief, would steal the naming rights. In the end, he called them Mandragora.

Without the help of these little weasel friends, I'd have no idea how to transport so many Iron Coins here without anyone noticing.\n\nSo, to commemorate their service (and hard work), I'll call these little critters \"Weasel Thieves,\" and grant them the title of \"Official Treasure Hoarders\" from now on!\n\n...Just kidding. If Miss Alia knew, in the afterlife, that I was giving wild weasels such absurd names, she'd probably jump right out of the Pillar of Embla and beat me up. There's no way I can call them that... Unless, of course, I were to write poetry in the future and fail to come up with any other name, or if no other name would make the rhythm and meter work.\n\nI have to say, Father had a real eye for hiding secret funds. This place is so well-concealed that not only would it be unlikely for anyone to stumble upon it, even wild weasels would have a hard time squeezing in here without guidance. It's such a pity that his foresight has only ever extended so far. Even when Rotwang used him up to the hilt, he never harbored the slightest suspicion.\n\nUltimately, the secret funds he hid here back then were only stolen because those two old geezers, Avrelian and Silvestr, came snooping around and coaxed the words out of me. By Her Majesty, the Tsaritsa! I was only five years old! Two young men playing good cop and bad cop, using both carrot and stick to get a five-year-old to talk. What normal human could come up with that? Actually, forget humans, what normal fae, jinn, seelie, specter, lochfolk, phantasm, or whatever creature would even think of this? Sacred heirs of the Frostmoon Scions indeed, what rotten, immoral behavior! Father chewed me out for three days afterwards, and even the Petrichor vacation I'd been promised got washed out. That said, that place got washed out later, too.\n\nWhat's more infuriating is that when I brought this up to Silvestr a while ago, he actually claimed he couldn't recall how he'd deceived me back then, just that Avrelian claimed to want the children to lead better lives. I completely understand their thoughts and actions: return all the wealth Father had plundered to those poor children. It was the right thing to do... But, really, did they have to do it through ME? Was I really the sole avenue through which a breakthrough could've been made, gentlemen?\n\nBesides — and Silvestr probably doesn't know this — the secret funds they stole, pretending to be chivalrous outlaws who robbed the rich to help the poor, were back in Father's coffers in less than three days — several times the original amount, extorted from other sources. Those self-important profiteers can always rake in wealth without lifting a finger, while the venal sycophants who surround them twist it into proof of their masters' innate diligence and wisdom. No one could become that rich otherwise, surely!\n\nThe game of robbing the rich to feed the poor only adds weight to the shackles of the impoverished. As Miss Alia's terrifyingly gloomy sister once told me: no matter how pure the water of goodwill, if it falls on soil poisoned with malice, seeds of evil are the only things that will grow. Avrelian probably realized this eventually, but his Elysium — no matter how firmly he believed it existed on Earth — remained much too far from those truly suffering in poverty. After all, how can someone who has never known a moment of kindness, someone constantly insulted and harmed, be expected to believe they should love their neighbor... or even their enemies?\n\nNeither Avrelian nor Miss Alia had ever answered that question. They were both kind people who imagined people to be better than they really were, believing that virtues and ideals could overcome the evil bred by circumstance. Unfortunately, I am just a selfish nobleman, and I lack their kindness. (I suspect Avrelian felt the same. After all, in his eyes, there has probably only ever been one truly kind noble in this world.) The things I've witnessed leave me unable to hold such idealistic confidence in human nature.\n\nIt's barely been a decade since Miss Alia's sacrifice, and those bandits who scattered like frightened birds and beasts have already begun brazenly misusing Avrelian's words to justify their atrocities against the innocent. Whether it's wandering merchants barely scraping by, or overworked laborers starving for their next meal, anyone could be branded a \"lackey of princes\" or a \"traitor who betrays his brothers and neighbors,\" and therefore \"ripe for their noble robbery.\"\n\nThose who came before overcame evil with noble ideals. Now, the bandits who claim to be their successors wave the same banner, declaring that anyone who opposes them is an enemy of those noble ideals, thus embodying the very evil that was once defeated.\n\nI can send the bandits who committed atrocities in the name of Reed Miller and oppressed the laboring poor to the Eye of Kratti, where they'll sleep with the fishes for good. In fact, I have already done so. But what about after I die? Who can guarantee that those once-noble ideals won't be twisted into crimes even I can't imagine?\n\nAl-Ahmar could not guarantee it, Erinnyes could not guarantee it, Xbalanque could not guarantee it, the noble lords of Mondstadt aristocracy failed to guarantee it, nor can the Frostmoon Scions guarantee it. And some so-called \"Master Thief Reed Miller\" will surely fail to guarantee it. Evil comes from humanity as naturally as honey from a hive.\n\nI'm neither Avrelian, nor Silvestr, nor Miss Alia, who enchants me so. I cannot place all my hope in human nature the way they did. I don't want the name of Master Thief Reed Miller to fade into history, forgotten by all. What's more, I don't want that name, and the ideals it once stood for, to be twisted by future villains and reviled by the public.\n\nHence, there's only one solution I can think of — let these so-called ideals be buried by history. Let us smother them beneath countless contradictory, absurd, laughable yet irresistible stories, until every trace of meaning is worn away and only a sweeping legend remains. This way, anyone who commits evil in our name will never be mistaken for a serious idealist. Rather, they shall be dismissed as childish dreamers, drunk on romantic tales.\n\nGreed always outlasts ideals. At least, that's what I believe. As long as the tale of the Great Treasure continues to be told, there will always be gamblers dreaming of making a fortune overnight, repeating the name of the \"Master Thief Reed Miller\" endlessly.\n\nBetter a harmless name — one that lets the poor laugh from the heart, one that gives them just a little more courage to face tomorrow — than a banner that villains would seek to claim.\n\nIf the rebels of some future age truly need a new banner, they will find a hero who belongs to their own time. And whatever that hero's name may be, it should never be \"Master Thief Reed Miller.\"\n\n..."},{"id":"Book1193","title":"Book1193","filename":"Book1193_EN.txt","text":"...\n\nI never imagined that someone would find the treasure vault just three weeks after I'd set it up.\n\nWhat surprised me even more was that I actually recognized the person.

He'd abandoned his own noble title and name long ago, choosing instead to spend the rest of his life protecting the children at the borderlands — those homeless children wandering through wastelands. At first, I thought he built a shelter. I didn't realize the children had never even seen him. He slew the wicked villains who sought to harm them, out of their sight. As for why he did it, what truly happened in Khaenri'ah, and how he ended up in Nod-Krai, he refused to say. Naturally, I didn't press further.\n\nThe old man had absolutely no interest in treasure, and hadn't even heard of the rumors I spread about the \"Great Treasure.\" He simply felt that something was off about this place, suspected it was a slaver's camp, and, following his instincts, stormed in with the intention of taking me out on the spot.\n\nAfter I finished explaining the thought process behind the treasure vault, the old man fell silent for a moment. He said that if a student had proposed such a ridiculous scheme back when he was Chief Instructor, he would've thrown it straight back and ordered them to start over.

He demanded that the Emperor pay tribute for ten years — the grain of six hundred granaries and gold to fill thirty storehouses, and sufficient slaves to transport such bounty. This was thirty times the amount that had been demanded of the Vila. The Emperor rejected this ultimatum, and both sides prepared for war [130] thereafter. The Emperor said, \"To sacrifice ourselves for the homeland is honorable. Let our comrades in this be our swords and our love. Our enemies proclaim peace, for they wish to stir up war. Should we shamefully give in to them (meaning the Volkodlak), our sons and daughters shall face war greater still. Thus, let us fight bravely for our survival. Let us taste the honeyed wine of victory, or let us make of ourselves a glorious oblation!\"\n\nIn the seventh year of the 428th Cycle, King Miscislav launched an assault upon Kitezh at the head of a great host: The Miscislavli clans marched with him, as did the people of Nyholmgarthir [131], Dalegrad [132], Cirnareka [133], and their numerous servants [134]. Three times the armies clashed at Kitezh, in the foothills, at the frozen lake, and on the plains; the Emperor slew King Miscislav [135] and many princes who followed him. Grand Duke Seriviiki [136] was fortunate to escape with his life, but both Grand Dukes Skoldyryt [137] and Vodyanoy [138] were pierced by the Emperor's spear [139] and slain. In his mercy and love the Emperor sought their bodies out and had them returned to their clans for burial. The Emperor said thus: \"They were not kings, nor born of sacred blood [140]. Never were they meant for rulership. Yet, heir to the Pale Star, and protector of all fae am I.\" Thus did the remaining clans of the fae seek an audience with him, and thus did he gain the authority to govern them. From that day forth, he named himself the Belyi Tsar.\n\n[127] Kitezh was the first city in all of Snezhnaya. This imperial capital was built after the custom of the fae ancestors, remaining the center of power over the frozen lands from the fourth year of the 417th Cycle — that is, the year of its founding — until His Majesty the Emperor, in his boundless mercy and grace, pardoned humanity and gave them membership in his realm, moving his seat to Snezhnograd.\n\n[128] Miscislav, known in The Volkhov Chronicles as the Blood-Devourer. The great ruler of all Volkodlak, the wise blood-drinker, the master of the Miscislavli alliance. According to the Volkodlak under his command, King Miscislav was a hulking figure, standing out even upon great battlefields like a mighty mountain. As such, he was also known by fae chroniclers as \"Gorynishche,\" or \"Son of the Mountain.\"\n\n[129] The term \"lovely,\" as pointed out in the \"Theory of Fae Language,\" can also be translated in our modern context as \"beneficial, lovable, or endearing.\" It should be evident that these words meant rather similar things in those days. The meaning of the Emperor's envoys' words, therefore, should be understood to mean: \"Their demand for tributes [from you] is undesirable (or perhaps 'unbeneficial') to you.\" Some scholars have as such interpreted the envoys' words as a veiled threat. For more relevant information, as well as the precise semantic scope of this term, please refer to the discussion found within the \"Theory of Fae Language.\"\n\n[130] Even to the eye of later generations, Miscislavli, the realm established by the wise amongst the Volkodlak, was entirely preposterous in its accusations against the Pale Star's royal court.\nYet the accusations were not wholly unreasoned. Or rather, King Miscislav, king of the Volkodlak, whose kingdom bore his name, sought to provoke war for a truer purpose. That is, his fear of the Pale Star court's rise since the previous conflict.\nUnder Emperor Monomakh, the alliance centered around Kitezhgrad developed an entirely new character over the course of the century. It rapidly advanced both in economy and governmental structure. To allow Emperor Monomakh to gain the upper hand in this tug of war was anathema to King Miscislav.\nThus began the war that would ultimately shape the destiny of this continent, shrouded in silver snow.\n\n[131] The Nyholmgarthir were Volkodlak of bovine aspect.\n\n[132] The Dalegrad were a clan of water imps.\n\n[133] The Cirnareka were Volkodlak with wolf-like appearances.\n\n[134] Primarily military retainers.\n\n[135] King Miscislav took personal command in these three large-scale battles against the Emperor. Legend has it that, driven by despair in that final battle, he sought to use the power of the Shadow Realm to delay the advance of the Pale Star court's forces. Though this measure failed to turn the tide, it did have an impact on the Emperor's future decisions.\nPlease refer to \"A History of the Snezhnyi Expedition\" for detailed records of said three battles.\nIt is worth noting that out on the flank, the Schpekin Legion had received orders from King Miscislav to pursue and prevent imperial forces from uniting. Yet, they were mysteriously misled by the icy fog that day. Misjudging their route of advance, they missed their opportunity to strike and could not prevent the imperial forces from linking up. This ultimately caused the defeat of Miscislav's forces in a head-on clash.\nThis incident has been recorded by a great many historians, but the cause of the sudden shift in the weather remains unknown.\nKing Miscislav was eventually slain when the Emperor's spear pierced through his head. It is said that the bear-shaped skull, large as a chariot, now housed in the Zapolyarny Palace Treasury, still bears the marks left by that spear.\n\n[136] Seriviiki, the \"Gray Wolf,\" so The Volkhov Chronicles record.\nRuler of Cirnareka. A cunning wolf, known for his agility, said to have engaged in clandestine dealings early in the war with Porfiry, the minister then in charge of the Pale Star's finances.\nFollowing the fall of King Miscislav's rule, he was the sole fae Grand Duke to slip immediately and effortlessly into the ranks of the ministers in the Pale Star's royal court.\nAs such, some scholars believe that the failure of the Schpekin Legion under his command to pursue battle at a critical moment was no mere accident, though this hypothesis cannot be considered supported by sufficient evidence.\nAfter the war, he was honored by Emperor Monomakh, then already known as the Belyi Tsar, with the ceremonial tap of the long sword on his shoulder.\n\n[137] Skoldyryt, known as the Deepwood Bull in The Volkhov Chronicles.\nGrand Duke of Nyholmgarthir, under Miscislav's command.\nDuring the second campaign, he proposed leading an elite vanguard to circle around to the rear of the Pale Star court's forces. He planned to launch a surprise attack and force them into an ambush zone, while the main army would encircle said zone and strike.\nHowever, intelligence regarding this strategy was seized by a fae who had infiltrated King Miscislav's army — Filipov, loyal to His Majesty the Emperor and most skilled in transformation techniques.\nThe Emperor adjusted his plans accordingly. Grand Duke Skoldyryt's surprise attack ironically led him to become deeply encircled by the Pale Star's royal army. The Pale Star forces entrapped his, all the while destroying any arriving relief columns, causing King Miscislav's forces to suffer a catastrophic defeat in the second battle.\nThe Grand Duke was then slain in this battle when His Majesty the Emperor's spear pierced his chest.\n\n[138] Vodyanoy, given the appellation \"The Lackland\" by The Volkhov Chronicles.\nRuler of Dalegrad, Forebear of All Waterborn in the Frozen Lake.\nA warrior of unparalleled valor, yet a brute like no other, skilled in launching surprise attacks from beneath the ice.\nTowards the end of the second campaign, the Grand Duke of the Domovoy, Alvis, lured his legions beyond the Frozen Lake through cunning strategy.\nKilled when the Emperor's spear pierced his chest.\n\n[139] The emperor's spear — Those unfamiliar with the battlefield often question many descriptions in the battle accounts, including the records of him wielding it to slay the enemy commanders as the two armies fought it out.\nMost skeptics typically argue that, given the size of the armies and the commanders' positions within their formations, it would have been almost impossible for the commanders to engage in direct combat amidst the chaotic melee.\nThe following must be clarified: The Emperor's feat of piercing the enemy commanders with his spear did not occur as the result of a direct engagement.\nRather, the spear was used as an arrow, launched with force unimaginable by common knowledge, piercing through the battlefield.\n\n[140] A sacred bloodline, the meaning of which is unknown. Emperor Monomakh laid claim to the title \"lord of all fae,\" and as such, he should have been of the same blood as the other fairies. It would seem that he merely used phrase as a means to establish legitimacy.\n\n...\nThe first year of the 799th Cycle. In the fourth month of this year, Anastasya Feodorovna was crowned Tsaritsa of all Snezhnaya. Many of the fae princes did not come unto Snezhnograd to seek an audience with her. The Dalegrad clan broke ties with Snezhnograd, for Emperor Monomakh had passed away.\n\nIn the second year of the 799th Cycle, the humans of Port Belovodye, taking advantage of Emperor Monomakh's demise, declared self-governance in the winter, rebelling against the fae princes. Grand Duke Drevogorye launched an assault against them, but failed to secure victory.\n\nIn the third year of the 799th Cycle, Tsaritsa Anastasya deployed troops to attack the forces of the independent government, occupying the territory of the Drevogorye, Volkhovan, and Cirnareka clans along the way. Charging them with negligence and condoning rebellion, their princely titles as rulers of these territories were revoked, their positions taken over by non-hereditary officials. Unlike Emperor Monomakh, she did not muster the Druzhna, but rather established a force known as the Fatui. It was they who conquered the lands of the fae princes. Grand Duke Drevogorye accused the Tsaritsa herself of treason, and met the Fatui with his own forces, and there he perished. On the tenth day of the third month, the Tsaritsa dispatched envoys to Port Belovodye. They calmed the separatist forces and requested that they hand over the instigators of the rebellion, promising amnesty to all others. The request was accepted, and thus did the port escape being leveled. On the twenty-third day of that same month, she then sent emissaries to all the fae princes who had not yet come to seek an audience with her. She demanded they hand over all their authority, promising that they would retain their honorary titles as aristocracy. Many would pass on before they could make their replies, and those who remained acceded. Thus did Tsaritsa Anastasya take control of the north.\n\nIn the fourth year of the 799th Cycle, the Tsaritsa bade the Fatui build a new fortress near Snezhnograd. Its name would be Glupov, meaning \"the city of fools.\"\n\nThe fifth year of the 799th Cycle.\n\nIn the sixth year of the 799th Cycle, the Tsaritsa established the Snezhnograd Veche to handle the administrative issues caused by the absence of the various princes. The human, Ioanna Ivanovna, was appointed its first chairperson.\n\nIn the seventh year of the 799th Cycle, the Imperial Order Reformation Edict was published. A great many princely fae, deeply grateful for the Tsaritsa's mercy and virtue, voluntarily forsook their noble titles and departed Snezhnaya.\n..."},{"id":"Book1198","title":"Book1198","filename":"Book1198_EN.txt","text":"Czcibor had been keeping watch in the hunting lodge for two days and two nights. The fresh snow that fell that morning covered the forest, making the night exceptionally quiet. Even he, a seasoned hunter, couldn't shake the drowsiness. But the memory of that girl in the village with her throat torn open, blood gushing relentlessly...\n\n\"That scoundrel must pay the price!\" This thought made Czcibor pull himself together. The dense forest seemed like a black veil woven from nightmares. At this moment, he heard a faint rustling sound from the southeast. A massive, dark shadow was approaching rapidly. In the blink of an eye, it was upon him. Czcibor gripped his crossbow tightly. There was poor visibility from his vantage point as a fallen pine tree blocked his view of the dark, shadowy figure. Through gaps in the pine needles, he could make out its foreclaws. Those claws were as large as his head, and the beast's coarse, jet-black fur resembled thorns sprouting from the night itself.\n\nSuddenly, the monster stopped. Had it seen me? Czcibor's muscles tensed, ready for battle. Unexpectedly, the beast before him turned away abruptly. \"Whoosh!\" Instinctively, he fired an arrow from his crossbow, striking the creature squarely in the right shoulder. Wincing in pain, the monster plunged headlong into the forest without looking back. Czcibor didn't hit a vital spot, of course, but at such close range, the wound must have been significant.\n\nCzcibor followed the trail of blood. The crimson trail vanished before a magnificent estate deep within the dense forest. It was almost as if the mansion within the estate was cut from an old oil painting and then transposed into the gloomy sea of trees. Its soaring spires pierced the treetops; faint white light seeped through the window panes, watching the visitors with cold, vigilant eyes. \"This is way too strange, no? Someone who lives in a house like this, choosing to stay in such a remote area?\" Czcibor rang the doorbell of the ancient mansion with suspicion.\n\nAn elderly, well-dressed butler answered the door. Aside from a slightly pallid complexion, he appeared to be human for certain. When Czcibor inquired about the wounded beast, the old butler shook his head blankly, claiming to have never seen it. The hunter explained that the trail of blood had led him here, suggesting that the monster might be hiding within the estate. Unless the monster was found, everyone would be in danger. After a moment's thought, the old butler brought the hunter to the master of the house — a young man in his early twenties, strikingly handsome. His thick, jet-black hair cascaded to his waist, fine and graceful. He listened quietly to their account before nodding and saying,\n\n\"You really trudged all the way here through the snow... A true hunter never lets go of prey that has already fallen into their grasp, it seems.\" To thank the hunter for his help, the master of the estate extended a warm invitation for the hunter to join him for dinner. A blizzard had begun raging outside, after all. Regardless of whether the hunter wanted to protect those within the manor or to hunt down the monster, he ought to take lodging there for the night.\n\n\"Black hair...\" Czcibor felt a twinge of suspicion. He had grown up in the Frostmoon Scions' encampment and had once heard the old priestess say that, among the fae, the \"Varcolac\" were the trickiest things to deal with. They had two hearts and could transform into two entirely distinct forms: human and fae. Yet, no matter which form they took on, their fur remained the same color. The wolf-like monster's fur was the exact same color as this young nobleman's hair.\n\nCzcibor hesitated briefly before accepting the invitation. Throughout the meal, he tried to get a read on the other man in all sorts of ways. Whether by adding pepper and garlic, flavors wolves detested, to the food, or by displaying the amulet he wore, which shimmered in the moonlight, nothing seemed to cause his host any displeasure. The young man ate the food elegantly and even took Czcibor's amulet in his hands, examining it closely. After the sumptuous meal, he even entertained Czcibor by playing a melodious song on the organ. Of course, the hunter did not let down his guard — naturally, he had no inclination to listen.\n\nAt long last, bedtime arrived. The young master rose to take his leave. Suddenly, he turned back to the hunter. With a meaningful look, he said, \"There is no moonlight tonight, and a snowstorm rages outside. Please do not leave your quarters under any circumstances. We can investigate that monster together first thing in the morning.\" Hmph, of course you'd say that, Czcibor thought to himself. He remained in his quarters until it was quiet outside, then ventured out carefully in the darkness. Skulking through the night was, after all, precisely a hunter's forte.\n\nThere was something very wrong about this estate.\n\nHe examined several servants, deep in slumber. All of them had strange scars on their limbs, neither deep nor shallow. They were not fatal, but it did not look as if they had injured themselves while working. Recalling the old butler's pallid complexion, Czcibor grew increasingly alarmed. He'd heard tales of the Varcolac having a particular fondness for tasting fresh, human blood. What sent another chill down his spine was the organ, which was actually made from bone! Moreover, as an experienced hunter, it did not seem as if the bones were from an ordinary wild beast or common livestock... Just as he was about to take a closer look, he heard the barely audible sound of footsteps coming from the room at the end of the corridor, running lightly towards the main gates. Czcibor slipped into the shadows and followed. Through the snowstorm outside, he could vaguely make out the figure ahead — it was the young master of the house.\n\nThe hunter pressed on, step by step, through the snowstorm. The two men arrived at a clearing in the dense forest one after the other. Suddenly, the young man stopped. Czcibor peered out from behind a tree. Amid the swirling snow, the dark-haired youth slowly stripped off every last garment he wore. There, on his right shoulder! A fresh, unhealed arrow wound!\n\nSuddenly, all the snow beside the young man — both the snow in the sky and on the ground — hung suspended in midair, revealing the Frostlamp Flowers on the forest floor, previously buried by the snow. The shimmering light on the flowers, like blood, streamed ceaselessly toward the young man. Whether it was an illusion or not, the wound on his shoulder seemed to begin healing gradually.\n\nIt was the Varcolac! Czcibor hesitated no more. A sneak attack was hardly honorable, but he was a human trying to kill a fae, and so he had no choice. Pulling out his dagger, he sprang from his hiding place, stabbing at the young man. Who would've thought that the young man would suddenly turn around and seize his wrist, almost plunging the blade into his chest? They fell to the ground, wrestling as the blade flashed at their fingertips. Their breaths and roars mingled in a chaotic tangle as neither would yield. In the struggle, Czcibor's strength gradually waned. Impossible! There was no way this slender young man could best him with sheer strength alone. \"Monster! You monster!\" Sensing that the tides had turned, the hunter let out a desperate, hopeless scream.\n\n\"No... I'm not... I'm not a monster...\"\n\nA hint of hesitation flashed through the young man's eyes. Now's his chance! Czcibor snatched the dagger back, burying it into his opponent's heart. Blood splattered through the falling snow as the young man's eyes slowly dimmed. Before the hunter could catch his breath, thick black fur began sprouting eerily from the body that should have been dead. The young man was rapidly transforming into the form of that enormous wolf-like monster. Shocked, Czcibor tried to pull out his dagger in an attempt to deliver more blows. But a massive claw pressed upon the blade's hilt, pinning it deep within its chest. The monster roared with laughter, the cruel sound ringing through the snowstorm. Staring at the hunter, it growled hoarsely yet excitedly:\n\n\"We Varcolac are born with two hearts.\" Blood gushed from the open wound, but the monster's eyes burned ever brighter. \"Thank you for piercing through that extraneous heart for me. Now, I am finally complete!\"\n\nScarcely had the words been spoken when the monster opened its maw, its fangs gleaming cruelly. With a cruel snap of its jaw, it lunged for the hunter's neck.\n\nThe tale abruptly ends here. Who can say for certain whether this is a legend or an undiscovered truth? Perhaps the fae known as the \"Varcolac\" really possess two hearts. They are now nearly extinct, and many have dismissed them as absurd myths. However, rumor has it that the Duchess, Lady Evlampiya Orlova of Snezhnaya, is actually a Varcolac, albeit one not covered in wolf fur. Verifying this legend would be simple enough. But, dear reader, you likely lack the courage to question that exalted lady herself!"},{"id":"Book1199","title":"Book1199","filename":"Book1199_EN.txt","text":"— Silvestr Petrovich Solovei —\nVI\n\"...\nSince you are kind enough to hear a dying man's shame,\nAllow me to express my thanks for your gentle grace.\nStill, how could the secrets of one's soul be caught in a simple phrase?\nCries of regret yield no harvest for the coming day.\nOnce, I too trusted the nobles' guileful tongues,\nAnd let their hollow vows obscure my sight.\nNot 'til farewell were the bitter facts wrung,\nAnd all our shattered dreams stood bare to the light.\n\nWhy do the tombs call forth such sorrowful plight?\nWhen comrades, homeland and my loved ones dear,\nHave found their rest within the endless night?

Knights should carefully read the content of this handbook and strictly hold themselves to the standards detailed within in their life and work, serving the people of Mondstadt as a model Knight of Favonius.\n\nAs members of the Knights of Favonius, it is incumbent upon us to be the very embodiment of the three virtues of knighthood: modesty, honesty, and self-control. These are the three pillars of Mondstadt's freedom — remember, freedom cannot exist without the support of duty.\n\nThe direct embodiment of these values comes, of course, in one's everyday speech and actions. Hence, this handbook outlines behavioral standards and language usage prescriptions that are intended to cover all potential scenarios that you may encounter in the course of duty.\n\nSection One\nA knight must exercise vigilance at all times and must never treat any potential threat to Mondstadt lightly. When it comes to your attention that a citizen of Mondstadt is in need, you must come to their aid promptly and willingly, for it is the fundamental duty of the Knights of Favonius to be of service to the people of Mondstadt.\n\nSection Two\nWhen greeting a traveling merchant from a distant land, pay attention to express proper respect and courtesy. Do not exhibit suspicion or hostility towards them, no matter how suspicious they may seem.\n\nApproved Language:\n\"Welcome to Mondstadt, strange yet respectable traveler(s)/wayfarer(s)/guest(s)!* Please state your identity and intended destination. The Knights of Favonius are here to ensure your safety.\"\n*Select the appropriate term of address accordingly.\n\nProhibited Language:\n1. \"Hey, you! Stop right there! State your identity, you rascal(s)/hooligan(s)/ruffian(s)/outlander(s)/trespasser(s)!\"\n2. \"Welcome to the City of Wind and Idylls, otherworldly traveler(s)/vagrant animal(s)/burgeoning storm(s).\"\nNote: Refrain from using vulgar or coarse language. It is especially important never to address the guest using pejorative nomenclature, for this is certain to make them feel most unwelcome indeed.\n\nSection Three\nNever meet members of the public with an attitude of nonchalance or apathy. A responsible knight must always be ready to offer up both sword and sweat for the people's sake. Accordingly, during periods of rest, recreation, or relative inactivity, you must maintain a knightly disposition and be ready to fully re-engage in work matters at a moment's notice.\n\nApproved Language:\n1. (Musing to oneself while on a break) \"I shall check for any previously undiscovered safety issues in Mondstadt — for I, as a knight, have a duty to safeguard Mondstadt at all times.\"\n2. (Conversing with city folk at the tavern) \"As a knight, I am expected to gain an understanding of people's day-to-day needs and concerns. This knowledge is also indispensable to me in the performance of my duties.\"\nNote: Even when there is no work to be done whatsoever, it is not permissible to take a gratuitous amount of downtime at your own discretion.\n\nProhibited Language:\n1. (On active guard duty) \"Imagine having a lifetime's supply of cider...\"\n2. (While taking a break) \"Noeeeelle... Have you got a minute...\"\nNote: The Acting Grand Master has instructed Noelle to immediately report any work-shy knights who attempt to delegate their existing duties to her. It should go without saying that this behavior is entirely unacceptable. Penalties for violations will take the form of reduced vacation allowance and/or salary deductions. The next time that you consider shirking your duties, you are strongly advised to consider whether the consequences are worth it.\n\nSection Four\nWhile the Knights of Favonius respect the important place of wine in Mondstadt's cultural heritage, it is nevertheless expected that knights will exercise due self-control with regard to their alcohol intake. It is not permitted to be drunk while on duty, and it is strictly forbidden to encourage or facilitate the consumption of alcohol by minors.\nNote: Knights of Favonius who are not of legal drinking age are forbidden from consuming alcohol. Accordingly, minors must always be accompanied by an adult coworker when entering taverns and other premises where alcohol is served.\n\nSection Five (New)\nOwing to a recent increase in Fatui activity in the city, knights are reminded that it is forbidden to disclose details of any matters concerning Knights of Favonius operations and strategic deployment to any persons from outside the organization while not on active duty.\n\nSection Six\nIn the event of a major Mondstadt-wide emergency, Knights of Favonius are expected to lead by example and act to safeguard human lives and property. In times of crisis, when people come to you with questions, it is important to answer them clearly and calmly, and to remind them to prioritize their personal safety at all times.\n\nApproved Language:\n1. \"Please, do not worry. The Knights of Favonius will do their utmost to protect Mondstadt!\"\n2. \"When danger is imminent, please do not panic. Cover your head with both hands, and crouch down better protect yourself. Then, follow the instructions given to you by the Knights of Favonius crew, who will lead you to safety in a swift and orderly fashion.\"\n3. (New) \"Please rest assured that even though Grand Master Varka is not currently in Mondstadt, the Knights of Favonius are quite well-equipped to deal with this crisis in a swift and elegant manner.\"*\n*Only applicable during the Grand Master's absence.\n\nProhibited Language:\n1. \"Uh-oh, we've never had to deal with a situation like this before...\"\n2. \"Even the knights are powerless in the face of a crisis of this magnitude...\"\nNote: Even in extreme cases where the crisis is indeed of a kind that has not been seen before, it is imperative that you do not appear overwhelmed in front of members of the public, and that you do not do or say anything to call into question the capabilities of the Knights of Favonius.\n\nSection Seven\nWhen greeting travelers from afar, please act hospitably by informing them of the locations of essential businesses and services, recommending popular tourist destinations, and giving any further assistance that they may request or require.\n\nApproved Language:\n1. \"If it's your first time here, I recommend visiting the Mondstadt Cathedral.\"\n2. \"If you're tired, go have some of Mondstadt's famous wine at a tavern called 'Angel's Share.'\"\n\nSection Eight\nRemember to espouse the virtues of modesty and honesty also in your interactions with coworkers and companions. That is to say, be self-effacing in conversation with comrades, and be open and truthful with them. Nurturing and maintaining a sense of camaraderie and solidarity between all our knights is our first line of defense against the enemy.\n\nApproved Language:\n\"That was wonderful! I've never had a battle experience like that before!\"\nNote: Avoid exaggerating your speech to the point where you become overbearing. Your words and tone should simply express a sufficient degree of respect and cordiality towards your fellow knights.\n\nSection Nine\nAs guardians of Mondstadt serving as the shield of the Anemo Archon, the Knights of Favonius must set an example for others to follow. Under no circumstances should any knight ever violate the rules and regulations of Mondstadt. If any knight is found to have damaged public property* (or the private property of a citizen of Mondstadt) while not on duty, following a damage assessment, an amount equivalent to the damages caused shall be deducted from the salary and/or bonus of the knight in question. Knights who are minors at the time of the violation, and who therefore do not receive a formal salary, will be penalized with solitary confinement in lieu of a fine, with the period of incarceration to be determined based on the severity of the violation.\n*The fish and other aquatic life found in Mondstadt's lakes and rivers are classed as public property, and as such must not be destroyed under any circumstances!\n\nSection Ten\nKnights of Favonius should always remain vigilant and exercise due caution when dealing with strangers. Even when dealing with non-hostiles, a knight should clarify to the stranger their rights and responsibilities as an outsider, explaining the rules and customs of Mondstadt in a firm but fair manner.\n(Amendment 1) Extra scrutiny is required when dealing with visiting diplomats from other nations whose activity gives cause for concern.\n\nSection Eleven\nIn the interests of preventing incidents involving wind glider users, Knights of Favonius should also pay close attention to aerial activity in the region. Knights are required to perform spot-checks on users of wind gliders and ensure that the details therein are current and valid. Should you observe any illegal aerial activity within the city, you should shout to the offender at the top of your voice, imploring them to cease gliding immediately. Should they persist, you should take such further action as is necessary to deescalate the situation.\nNote: Even if the airborne offender is an off-duty member of the Knights of Favonius, this is no cause for leniency. You have full authority to revoke the offending party's gliding license should you deem this to be the appropriate course of action.\n\n\nAppendix: Terminology Notes\n\n1. Knightly virtues\nRefers to the three core virtues of modesty, honesty, and self-control espoused by the Knights of Favonius. The three are mutually reinforcing and treated as a collective. Knights must conduct themselves in accordance with these virtues at all times.\n\n2. Terms of address\nRefers to the various honorifics used to address members of the public, including visitors to Mondstadt. As public servants to the free people of Mondstadt and hosts to others from beyond our borders, we are expected to use the appropriate terms of address in all encounters as an act of courtesy. An education in etiquette is mandatory for all serving knights.\n\n3. Duty\nRefers to our responsibilities to serve the people of Mondstadt and protect the freedom of Mondstadt. Officially appointed Knights of Favonius should refrain from talking flippantly or irreverently about their responsibilities or their honor as a knight in their day-to-day lives, so as to preserve the dignity of our organization's reputation.\n\n4. The Anemo Archon (New)\nThe Anemo Archon Barbatos is the God of Wind and Song, the granter and guardian of Mondstadt's freedom, and the one in whom the people of this land place their faith. As an organization, the Knights of Favonius heeds the will of the Anemo Archon. This means that we must be prepared to go to war in the event that Mondstadt's freedom comes under threat.\nNote: Need to add additional material on this term.

However, the shanties of the crew seldom made any mention of hunting creatures of the deep. It's not that the sailors didn't revel in their reputation and brag of their achievements, but ages of navigating the merciless seas had taught them that ballads of blood and water were the most unlucky of all.\n\nWith his sword in hand, the Skipper sailed across the watery expanse, coasting along rocky reefs and cruising with surging undercurrents.

Any monster that would dare stir the tranquil waters often became the next trophy hanging from the side of the ship.\n\nBut the Skipper only knew wind and waves, and never seemed to grasp the bittersweet lives of ordinary people. For he occupied all his days with searching and hunting, accompanied solely by the salty sea breeze and the muffled calls of whales in the deep.

For these stories share something in common with the slurred speech and sea-sickness-inducing swaying that so often accompanies them, which is that despite being clumsy and awkward, they are also highly entertaining.\n\nLegend has it that there was once a famous drunkard in Mondstadt. It was said that he could hold his alcohol as well as any hunter from Springvale in the off season. And yet, still he would drink till he was drunk. Every time that he drank, he would not budge so much as an inch back from the bar at the tavern until not a single Mora was left in his coin pouch, and not a single drop of wine remained in his glass.\n\nOne night, this drunkard was doing his best to stumble home after a particularly satisfying session of especially heavy drinking. A combination of his spinning head, blurred vision, and zigzagging stride served to navigate him towards a forest populated by wolves.\n\nToday, of course, Wolvendom is presided over by the Great Wolf King of the North, and the ominous atmosphere that emanates from inside the forest is sufficient to deter most sober-headed visitors from approaching the area. According to the elderly hunters, the Wolf King gathered the spirits of the wolves there to prevent outsiders from trespassing into territory where they are not welcome.\nBut this was an age long before the Wolf King and the north wind had descended upon that forest, bringing order and peace to the wolven race. At that time, the forest was a perilous place where wild wolves fought for survival. A fierce blood feud between wolves played out deep inside the dense foliage, concealed from view and unbeknownst to any human.\n\nLeast of all to the drunkard, who had by this point managed to transport his drunken self quite some distance inside the forest.\n\nHe stumbled forward in the darkness with that dogged determination that only drunkards possess, deterred neither by the tree roots that would trip him up every few steps, nor by the stray branches that would slyly slap him in the face from time to time.\nBefore long, a pair of green eyes began darting through the forest, their gaze fixed on him, tracking his every move.\nThose eyes belonged to a lone wolf, who silently pursued the drunkard from behind, all the while musing to itself:\n\"This is the most peculiar sight I have ever seen in all my life.\"\n\nNo one had dared set foot in the wolves' forest in hundreds of years, be they a knight clad top to toe in shining steel armor or a desperate fugitive dressed in rags. Even the callous nobles refused to exile their slaves there, for fear of inciting the wrath of the wild wolves and bringing unwanted trouble to their own territory.\n\n\"And yet, this odd fellow dares to stroll in here all by himself.

Another way of putting this is that their noses are much more sensitive.\nLittle wonder, then, that the stench of alcohol emanating from the wolf's now historically intoxicated prey was quite stifling, and caused tears to well up in its eyes.\n\n\"Awoo...\" the wolf thought to itself.\nHaving been born in the wilderness and grown up in the forest, the wolf had never had any contact with human civilization before this night, and though it had once caught the faint scent of wine wafting across Cider Lake, it did not know the scent's origin, less still understand the significance of that substance to humankind.\n\n\"Perhaps this peculiar fellow is a relative of the skunk, for it seems that he discovered my presence quite some time ago, and now means to poison me in an effort to secure his escape!\"\nThe wolf pondered this possibility as it braced itself against the onslaught of alcoholic fumes, picked up its pace, and discreetly maneuvered its way into the drunkard's shadow — the perfect vantage point from which to inspect its prey.\n\nThe wolf is a creature of caution and calculation. The drunkard, meanwhile, is a different sort of creature entirely.\nAnd yet, though wine tends to dizzy the mind and dull the senses, it sometimes affords its consumers the curious capacity to detect the subtlest of changes in the direction of the wind.\nPerhaps this could explain how a bumbling drunkard, fumbling through the forest, was suddenly able to discover the presence of a wolf that had been stealthily following him the entire time.\nOr perhaps the alcoholic fumes given off by the drunkard were sufficiently potent to diminish the wolf's mental acuity, to the point that the wolf became less mindful of the terrain beneath its paws, the resulting sound of snapping twigs thus alerting the prey to the predator's presence.\n\n\"Who's that? Don't s'pose you know which way the toilet is, by any chance...?\"\nThe bumbling drunkard rubbed his bleary eyes.\n\"Foul-smelling human,\" snarled the wolf, \"Who are you, and whence proceeds your stench?\"\nThe wolf flared its nostrils, bore its fangs, and growled.\n\nNot only was the drunkard unafraid when he heard the wolf's gruffly voiced threat, but he even became quite animated.\n\"My friend!\" the drunkard replied, \"Clearly I've offended you, somehow... sorry 'bout that... but anyway, Mondstadt tradition says you're not allowed to be drunk and bored at the same time...

In fact, it was poised to deliver a fatal blow to its prey by lunging for the neck, sinking its fangs in, and tearing his throat clean out.\nBut the drunkard's belch blasted a further bout of fumes in the wolf's direction, assailing its nostrils with such force that it ruined the wolf's appetite entirely. Grudgingly, the wolf agreed.\n\"Grr... Perhaps I'm not so hungry after all... Let's see what nonsense tale you have to tell.\"\n\nThe drunkard stretched out his arms and let out a loud yawn, disturbing a few dandelions in the process.\nAnd with that, the drunkard began to tell his tale."},{"id":"Book144","title":"Book144","filename":"Book144_EN.txt","text":"Legend tells of a lone wolf that roamed a barren wasteland far, far away.\n\nOnce, he had been king of his pack, leading them in the hunt, in battle, and in the search for a home... Now, the sole remaining legacy of those days were the scars that covered his body.\n\nHe had led the way as they ran across open plains, navigated through abandoned ruins, and passed through the domains of monsters and the Seelie.\nThe wasteland was a cruel place. The wolf-king grew older with each passing day, and the other wolves gradually dispersed. As time went by, the wolf pack's history faded into distant memory, until finally only the aged wolf-king remained, the sole survivor of its pack.\n\nThis wasteland is said to be a land beyond the dominion of deities, inhabited only by the grotesque ghostly remains of fallen gods, where the former palaces of the Seelie now stand empty. So when the solitary old wolf passed by a gray palace and heard the sound of music coming from within, it caught its attention.\n\n\"Never before have I heard a sound so pleasing to the ears, whether it be a song of bird or insect, that it stays the pangs of hunger in my starved stomach as this tune does.\"\nIntrigued, the wolf stepped inside the gray hall, trod across the overgrown weeds, and passed by a broken sarcophagus, on which a portrait of the deceased ruler was still clearly visible.\n\nFinally, he came to an inner room, where he saw a fair maiden strumming at her instrument.\nHer skin was ashen white and her head was bowed down, her slender fingers gently stroking the fragile strings of the lute as she played a long-forgotten and mournful melody.\n\nThe wolf sat down in front of the pale young maiden and forgot all about the pain of hunger, thirst, and loneliness for a short while, as it listened in silence to her song.\n\n\"The chirping of insects on a long-gone autumn night is the chorus of exiles, singing mankind's most ancient song as they live out their plight...\"\n\"Stripped of all that the body once held close and the soul once held dear, songs and memories are all that now remain of yesteryear.\"\n\"The last singers, the first Seelie, they played their final tune in the hall of angels.\"\n\nThe tiny Seelie playing in the forest were also drawn to the young maiden's tune, and flocked to her to pay their respects.\n\n\"What is this song that you play?\"\nThe wolf asked, puzzled, for it understood every line, every word, every syllable she spoke — and yet, hers was a language that it had never heard before, quite unlike that of any other living being.\n\n\"A song of the Seelie,\"\nReplied the pale young maiden in a soft voice.\n\"Long, long ago, we wrote this song for the human savages. Yet now, we sing it to mourn our own fate.\"\n\nThe wolf began to sing along, albeit clumsily, to the maiden's tune.\nThe wolf's voice was husky and broken, filled with a lifetime of sorrow.\n\n\"What are you singing?\"\nThe maiden asked of the wolf.\n\n\"This is our song,\"\nResponded the wolf.\n\n\"It sounds ghastly.\"\nThe maiden made no attempt to soften her criticism as she continued to caress the lute strings.\n\"But, you are welcome to sing along with me all the same.\"\n\nAnd so, a shared chorus sung by fair young maiden and weary old wolf filled the chambers of the long-abandoned palace. It is said that to this day, adventurers who pass by this place still hear a strange yet harmonious melody sounding from within.\n\n\"And then? ...The story ends here?\"\nThe wolf licked its lips, somewhat ruefully, and then said:\n\"I suppose I shall tell you a story now.\"\n\nAnd with that, the wolf cleared its throat and began to tell its tale."},{"id":"Book145","title":"Book145","filename":"Book145_EN.txt","text":"Legend has it that the first wine of Mondstadt was brewed in the age when the north wind howled.\n\nIn the age when the Kings of Ice and Frost fought for dominion, Mondstadt's forbears brewed rudimentary wine from wild fruits, even as they shivered in the biting cold. They did so to ease the pain of their frostbitten fingers and to give them the courage to face the harsh and unforgiving ice. For at that time, the land of Mondstadt was engulfed by ice and snow, and the dandelions had not yet reared their heads.\n\nIt is said that the first person in Mondstadt to discover the craft of wine brewing was a grossly negligent guard.\n\nIn a tribe beset by blizzards on all sides, it was the unenviable job of the hardy hunter-gatherers to stock the storage pits with food, and it was the guard's task to guard against intruders.\nThe sight of a human intruder was a rare one indeed in that harsh environment — but there were other creatures who could better withstand the cold, and they would burrow underground to reach the food stocks. The rules of the tribe were that one person should inspect the storage pits at all times, filling in any mouse holes discovered — or better still, catching them red-handed in the act of pilfering — to keep the tribe's food supplies at plentiful levels.\n\nAt that time, the damp, dark caves needed constant care and attention to prevent the food they held from going bad and rotting. On top of this, the mischievous little creatures that hid away out of sight would sometimes play pranks on the guards.\n\nOne day, a wily wind spirit noticed that the grossly negligent guard was once again being grossly negligent. So, the spirit took the form of a fox and crept into a pile of wild apples. There, it caused yeast to grow, ripening the apples and causing them to ferment.\nThe grossly negligent guard was ravenous when he returned, and elected to partake of one of the apples. The mellow taste of fermented fruit delighted both his body and his mind. Immediately, he took animal hide and squeezed the juice from the apples, creating wine.\n\nThe grossly negligent guard who first invented brewing in the age of ice and snow also became Mondstadt's first drunkard. It is said that he was the first person ever to fall into a drunken dream.\n\nIn his first drunken dream, he drunkenly entered the dreams of a lone wolf. Somewhere in the long-lost past or possibly the far-flung future, he fought fang and claw with rival wolf packs, battled with humans for food in the midst of a raging snowstorm, and met the first Seelie.\n\nThe tribe-dwelling human and the pack-dwelling wolf could not bear to live in solitude. This newly brewed wine served to bring man and wolf together in their dreams.\n\nBut their attitudes towards these dreams were poles apart.\n\nThe human who knew only the wind and snow yearned for the wasteland where the lone wolf runs freely, but the lone wolf was fearful of the human's desire. It could not understand why this human was captivated by dangerous illusions and sought hope from within them.\nWhat concerned the wolf even more was that when in a drunken human dream, it could no longer distinguish whether it was a wolf or a human with a wolven spirit.\n\nSo the wolf swore an oath never to touch the humans' poison again, to resist the allure of wine.\nWolves are not the children of the wind, and the land of wine and song is not their home. So the wolves left the humans' domain and settled far off in the wilderness and deep in the mountain forests, places where the scent of wine could not reach them.\n\n\"What you humans call wine, we wolves call the abyss,\"\nThe wolf haughtily concluded.\nBut as the wolf turned towards the drunkard to say this line, it discovered that the drunkard was now lying fast asleep on a bed of pine branches.\n\nThe wolf was most displeased, and violently expelled a puff of air from its nostrils before leaving the still-pungent pile of sleeping human to his business, and going on its way."},{"id":"Book146","title":"Book146","filename":"Book146_EN.txt","text":"The words on this sundial seem to follow on from the one by the Thousand Winds Temple.

Closed during daylight hours, it only opened to customers once the moon began to rise in the night sky. The shop's customers were anything but ordinary: they were the wealthy and leisurely, people with outstanding taste.\n\nA meticulously crafted timepiece from Fontaine, incense from Sumeru, a wine goblet once owned by an aristocrat of old Mondstadt, a wooden stool whose surface was once graced by the buttocks of an adeptus for all of one hour, a delicate jade teacup from which the Lord of Geo once supped a sip of tea, a priceless celadon vase that Liyue's neighbor deity, the Anemo Archon, once accidentally knocked to the ground, shattering it to pieces... All these and more were laid out for the customers to peruse at their leisure, each item just waiting for that one person with whom it shared a certain affinity.\n\nOne night, a wealthy young man who was walking by happened to pause in front of the shop, and began carefully examining the items on the shelves.\n\nThe owner was struck by his long, black robes, dark and solemn as the looming mountain peaks, and by his eyes, which were the color of amber.\n\nThis was no ordinary young man.

She recalled how she had haggled relentlessly with the adventurer to acquire the piece, and how in the end it had still cost her the better part of her fortune.

Like the rocks, he was without warmth or softness.\nDespite this, people revered and placed their faith in him all the same. This was because his laws served to guarantee that trade was fair and that life was safe and orderly. The Geo Archon grew in strength and stature because of the people's belief in him.\n\nBut even gods are powerless to control the beliefs and doubts of their mortal followers.\nAnd even a god who is the guardian of justice has no means of instilling the words of his rules and regulations into the heart of every individual.\n\nIn Mingyun Village, there was an incorrigibly irreverent jade craftsman who loved to jest. Whatever job he took on, he would complete it in the most unorthodox means imaginable, and would always finish the job on the very last day before it was due.\n\nIf a customer ordered a statue of a hunter dominating a ferocious beast, they would receive a miniature statue of a distressed boar running for its life.\nAnd when the customer demanded an explanation, he would tell them:\n\"When a formidable hunter closes in on a fierce beast, he may not show his face, but his imposing presence is enough to frighten the beast to its core.\"\n\nIf a customer ordered a carving in the likeness of a powerful and mighty ruler, they would probably receive a statue of a majestic throne.\nAnd when asked about it, he would reply:\n\"No ruler takes the throne for more than one hundred years. The throne has more longevity than he.\"\n\nThe craftsman quickly developed a reputation as an eccentric in Mingyun Village. But the wealthy merchants in the prosperous commercial port of Liyue Harbor were most amused and were only too willing to place orders with him — if only to experience for themselves what it was like to be on the receiving end of this mischievous man's antics.\n\n——————\n\nOne night, a woman came to his workshop.\nShe was dressed in a long, slender black gown and her eyes shone a brilliant amber in the light of the crescent moon hanging in Liyue's sky that night.\nThe craftsman had never met her before, but he quickly found himself deep in conversation with her.

Regardless, there was certainly something out of the ordinary about this woman.\nAt least, the craftsman thought so.\n\n\"I would like for you to make me a jade plaque bearing the likeness of the Lord of Geo on its surface.\"\nThe woman finally stated her request once their broad-reaching and lengthy conversation had reached its end, and she was all but ready to leave.\n\"But I have one condition: You may not conjure up our Lord's likeness from your imagination. You must carve the true likeness of our Lord relying on what you have seen with your own two eyes.\"\n\"Otherwise,\" she said, \"I'm not paying a single Mora.\"\n\nAnd so a deal was struck between the two, with an agreed turnaround of three days.\n\nOn the first day, the craftsman dined and drank with his good friends.

They did so to ease the pain of their frostbitten fingers and to give them the courage to face the harsh and unforgiving ice. For at that time, the land of Mondstadt was engulfed by ice and snow, and the dandelions had not yet reared their heads.\n\nIt is said that the first person in Mondstadt to discover the craft of wine brewing was a grossly negligent guard.\n\nIn a tribe beset by blizzards on all sides, it was the unenviable job of the hardy hunter-gatherers to stock the storage pits with food, and it was the guard's task to guard against intruders.\nThe sight of a human intruder was a rare one indeed in that harsh environment — but there were other creatures who could better withstand the cold, and they would burrow underground to reach the food stocks. The rules of the tribe were that one person should inspect the storage pits at all times, filling in any mouse holes discovered — or better still, catching them red-handed in the act of pilfering — to keep the tribe's food supplies at plentiful levels.\n\nAt that time, the damp, dark caves needed constant care and attention to prevent the food they held from going bad and rotting. On top of this, the mischievous little creatures that hid away out of sight would sometimes play pranks on the guards.\n\nOne day, a wily wind spirit noticed that the grossly negligent guard was once again being grossly negligent. So, the spirit took the form of a fox and crept into a pile of wild apples. There, it caused yeast to grow, ripening the apples and causing them to ferment.\nThe grossly negligent guard was ravenous when he returned, and elected to partake of one of the apples. The mellow taste of fermented fruit delighted both his body and his mind. Immediately, he took animal hide and squeezed the juice from the apples, creating wine.\n\nThe grossly negligent guard who first invented brewing in the age of ice and snow also became Mondstadt's first drunkard. It is said that he was the first person ever to fall into a drunken dream.\n\nIn his first drunken dream, he drunkenly entered the dreams of a lone wolf. Somewhere in the long-lost past or possibly the far-flung future, he fought fang and claw with rival wolf packs, battled with humans for food in the midst of a raging snowstorm, and met the first Seelie.\n\nThe tribe-dwelling human and the pack-dwelling wolf could not bear to live in solitude. This newly brewed wine served to bring man and wolf together in their dreams.\n\nBut their attitudes towards these dreams were poles apart.\n\nThe human who knew only the wind and snow yearned for the wasteland where the lone wolf runs freely, but the lone wolf was fearful of the human's desire. It could not understand why this human was captivated by dangerous illusions and sought hope from within them.\nWhat concerned the wolf even more was that when in a drunken human dream, it could no longer distinguish whether it was a wolf or a human with a wolven spirit.\n\nSo the wolf swore an oath never to touch the humans' poison again, to resist the allure of wine.\nWolves are not the children of the wind, and the land of wine and song is not their home. So the wolves left the humans' domain and settled far off in the wilderness and deep in the mountain forests, places where the scent of wine could not reach them.\n\n\"What you humans call wine, we wolves call the abyss,\"\nThe wolf haughtily concluded.\nBut as the wolf turned towards the drunkard to say this line, it discovered that the drunkard was now lying fast asleep on a bed of pine branches.\n\nThe wolf was most displeased, and violently expelled a puff of air from its nostrils before leaving the still-pungent pile of sleeping human to his business, and going on its way.\n"},{"id":"Book166","title":"Book166","filename":"Book166_EN.txt","text":"...\n\nThanks to help from Venerare and...

In this way, mortals were guided along the path towards prosperity and to triumph over the obstacles that lay in their way, and thus did the domain of the Geo Archon remain strong and steadfast.\nWhen peace returned once more after the Archon War, the city of Liyue Harbor began to flourish under the government of the Qixing, who represented every trade in Liyue, and who also acted as intermediaries between mortals and their god, taking responsibility for communicating with the Geo Archon, explaining his divine predictions to the people in clear and simple terms, and issuing the official policy for the forthcoming year.\nNaturally, the illustrious individual tasked with hosting the Rite of Descension can only be chosen from among the Qixing, and no one other than that person is permitted to intervene in the proceedings.\nIn the minds of the many merchants of Liyue Harbor, the divine predictions of Rex Lapis are more precious than the metals and minerals of the mountain mines.\nThus, no matter how far from home they may have strayed by the day that Rex Lapis descends, all will seek to make the journey back in person, or at least send someone in their place, so that they may receive the guidance of the Geo Archon and safeguard their financial fortunes for the year ahead.\nThe raving-mad sages of the nation of rainforests drive themselves to hysterics as they abandon all that is worldly in their pursuit of elusive and esoteric wisdom, but the people of the land of karst cliffs are accustomed to welcoming the generous guidance of their deity as a means towards a worldly end — namely, their continued prosperity.\nIt would seem that, while The Seven stand shoulder-to-shoulder in their roles as Archons of the mortal realm, there are moments where their paths diverge and even run directly counter to one another."},{"id":"Book168","title":"Book168","filename":"Book168_EN.txt","text":"...\n\nThanks ██ ███ ███ ██████ ████ I ███ ████ ███ ██ ██ █████ ███ ████ █ ██ ███ ██████ ████\n\n██ ███ █ ██ tallest █████ ███ ██ ████ dangerous.

Qingce is a slope known as Wuwang Hill, a palpably ominous place and the setting of many tales of supernatural phenomena.\nIt is rumored in Liyue that the spirits of the dead lurk within the woods on Wuwang Hill. They roam the perimeter of the decrepit village, wandering among the withering trees and rotting foliage, eternally yearning for things left unresolved in living years. These floating spirits often entice unsuspecting passers-by away from the main path and onto treacherous mountain tracks that lead them tumbling into a river or straight into an ambush of ravenous monsters.\nIt is this phenomenon from which Wuwang Hill derives its name. Wuwang means \"prudence\" in the common tongue, and Wuwang Hill is said to be \"the hill where the prudent are punished.\" For even those travelers who do not act rashly or impulsively on their journey are doomed to be ensnared by the malevolence that lingers here like the mist in the mountain air.\nBoth innocent villagers and ignorant visitors alike are susceptible to the deception of the Wuwang Hill spirits, which draw them deep into dark woods where thick mist blots out the sky and unknown dangers lurk in the shadows. There are many means by which these sinister spirits are able to deceive mortals. Some take the form of bereavement or grief, others of regret, manifesting as voices and visages of the deceased, the love of the departed, or the remorse of another party in an unresolved dispute. The traveler finds themselves compelled to heed the spirit's cry, and follows them into the depths of Wuwang.\nBut Wuwang Hill was not always this way. Some signs of life remained there up until relatively recently, and in times gone by the village at the foot of the slope enjoyed a peaceful and leisurely existence, the chimneys always smoking and the lanterns always lit. That same village stands abandoned today... The buildings are in ruins and all that remains of the villagers is the indistinct murmuring from a realm beyond.\nThere is a fable that is oft-repeated among the children of Qingce Village. It holds that the young people of Wuwang Hill, enchanted by the whale-like song of a faraway sea monster, all threw themselves into the gently flowing Bishui River in pursuit of false promises and childlike dreams. Along the river they floated, making their way to the Sea of Clouds, where they became one with the waves and lost all memory of the woods and their village on the hill... Their dreams, meanwhile, became the sea monster's song.\nGeneration after generation of young people disappeared in this way, until in the end, the sole remaining residents of Wuwang Hill were old and gray. One by one, they left this mortal plane amidst sighs of grief. The bright lights of Liyue Harbor, Rex Lapis's pride and joy, burned ever brighter, while another neglected mountain village turned into a silent ghost town.\nBut unlike the fleeting and fickle human mind, the ever-flowing ley lines remember all. Surging elemental energy takes on spirit form to recreate all the dreams, both fair and foul, of Wuwang Hill's erstwhile residents. Much like a mother who once lost a child and now searches desperately through their irretrievable past for a way to bring everything back, the ley lines — albeit unconsciously — repeatedly recreate the past and those who inhabited it. The way each looked, the way each child cried, the way the elderly would sigh in their twilight years. Each moment of joy, and each moment of sorrow. And like the hypnotic song of the great creatures of the deep sea, it unintentionally lures toward it any nostalgic soul who would dare trespass here."},{"id":"Book16","title":"Book16","filename":"Book16_EN.txt","text":"The fourth poem:\nCeli upa celi\nSada shato lata\nKuzi unu ya zido\nUnu dada\n\nA song sung by samachurls.

It may appear ridiculous in mainstream academic circles, and I have no intention of casting doubt upon well-established views, but I feel obliged to say that the question of whether philosophical discourse truly exists among the hilichurls is one that still fascinates me to this day, and may be deserving of further study.\n\nThe fifth song:\nNini movo muhe yoyo\nNini movo mimi tomo\nLata movo mosi yoyo\nCeli movo celi yoyo\n\nMuch like the people of Mondstadt, the wind-worshiping hilichurl tribes often drink to excess and sing endless songs of praise to the Anemo Archon.

These glowing spirits are unfailingly found hovering in the mountain mist, in the ruins of ancient cities, or in crumbling, decrepit villages. Should a Vision-bearer draw near, the seelie will guide the way for them, leading them to long-hidden treasure or unfathomably ingenious mechanisms.\nThe people of Liyue believe these tiny, silent spirits to be auspicious sightings, the souls either of departed adepti or unnamed benevolent gods of old. Others believe they are the echoes of strangers without kin, lingering in the mountains to guide lonely, lost visitors onto the path back home.\nAnother old legend told in the mountain villages claims that there was once a time, before the adepti had come into being, when the seelie who meander in the mountains knew an altogether different existence, one in which they had beautiful physical forms and possessed great wisdom. That era, when the seelie roamed the mountains and strolled through the grand halls in the cities of old, is said to date back even further than the days when Rex Lapis fought bitterly against countless rival gods.\nAt a far-flung moment in the distant past, the ancestor of the seelie met a traveler from afar, with whom they swore an oath of union witnessed by the three sisters of the Lunar Palace. Just thirty days later, a sudden disaster struck. The seelie and their lover fled into exile as the world collapsed around them, fleeing until the terrible calamity caught up with and seized them. Their cruel punishment was to be separated from each other for eternity and to have their memories wiped without a trace.\nThe graceful but heartbroken seelie and the sisters grew more sullen and withdrawn with each passing day, to the point where their wondrous forms withered away, leaving fragments of their former selves scattered in the mountains and ruins, where they turned into tiny little life forms. They had forgotten so much, lost so much, and been stripped of their voices and wisdom, yet they continued to sing their same songs of grief. Because of this, still harboring a shred of the deep love they once had for their long-lost lover, they will act as guides to travelers who stop in the mountain mist, seeking to retrace their memories of an ancient story in long-abandoned ruins, disused makeup cabinets, and now-undecipherable poetry.\nOf course, these are nothing but clumsy, incoherent folk tales, wild and fantastical conjecture about what Liyue may have been like in the distant past before the time of Rex Lapis. Needless to say, such tales have no credibility whatsoever. The true origin of these sorrowful spirits that meander in the mountains is, however, still widely debated, and no consensus has ever been reached on the topic."},{"id":"Book171","title":"Book171","filename":"Book171_EN.txt","text":"...\n\nCommerce and trade, like springs and streams, begin with the mountains and end with the seas.

The strong should not bully the weak, nor should weakness be despised and strength glorified. Let it be known to all that trade and commerce allows the river of gold to flow unimpeded along its natural course — this is the just and upright way.\nSome say: \"There are those who lose their jobs and have no reliable source of food, nor a roof over their heads, they toil in vain in their barren fields. All the while, the wealthy merchants' residences overflow with gold and jade. What justice and uprightness is this?\"\nThis question is devoid of insight. Like the waves that face off against the golden sands of the shoreline, the pursuit of profit topples much of what stands in its way, and like the rapids that run in the valleys, it is unrelenting. Thus those in poverty will not stay poor forever, just as the wealthy shall not hold onto their riches for eternity — but the treasury must always be filled for the nation to remain peaceful and prosperous.\nHence, it is the proper way of things to eschew prohibition, expand the economy, and reform the government.

It also has a most delightful scent that can survive multiple rounds of processing, and even the weaving process itself. For this reason, Liyue's botanists have cultivated a special strain for exclusive use in perfume making — with the most luxurious perfumes being offered first and foremost, of course, to Rex Lapis for his approval.\nFor the women of Liyue, highly prized Silk Flower perfumes are seen as holding different symbolic meanings based on the fragrance profile and composition. The unwritten rule in Liyue is that it is impolite to broach the topic of perfume with a woman in normal social interaction, but also that if an admirer is able to correctly guess the type of perfume one is wearing, as well as correctly deduce its unique properties and characteristics, all whilst conveying this in an articulate and tactful manner, the admirer is more likely to stand a chance of winning one's affection.\nA popular belief in the rural regions of Liyue is that the method for decocting Silk Flower perfume was originally taught to mortals by an adeptus living as a hermit on Mt. Aocang. In the age where divine beings coexisted alongside lowly mortals, the adeptus guided humans to learn the ways of courting and romancing from the birds, beasts, and plants. To a young woman bathing in a spring, it once took the form of a graceful illuminated bird, teaching her the exotic techniques of decocting and applying fragrant oils.\nWho was this young woman capable of stirring the heart of an adeptus living in deliberate seclusion from the world? With countless legends offering different versions of the story, the truth is impossible to know. But the art of decocting perfume from Silk Flowers was indeed passed on, for it survives to this very day. It is claimed that the subtle undertones of the perfume's scent and the gentle-but-nimble hand techniques used in the decoction process have remained unchanged throughout history on account of having proved themselves supremely fit for purpose time and time again.\nAs they grow, Silk Flowers will exhibit different properties based on how their environmental conditions differ from their ancestral habitat. Liyue's merchants have coined plenty of tasteless terms for Silk Flowers of all types and uses. They tend to attribute them to Rex Lapis, claiming they once had the fortune to encounter him during one of his excursions in the mortal realm or pass them off as a merciful gift from an adeptus, such details always featuring as part of a wondrous, fantastical narrative. Sales tactics like these always manage to garner the interest of a shopper or two on their way through Liyue Harbor.\nHigh demand has pushed Liyue's merchants towards the mass cultivation of Silk Flowers and the ongoing breeding of new strains. This means that the striking sight of beautiful Silk Flowers is a common one in all highly populated areas, including the city and the towns. Sadly, geographical changes over Liyue's long history and ever-expanding mining activity have conspired to destroy the natural habitat of wild Silk Flowers, meaning that the flower is all but extinct in rural areas. The handful that can still be found in the wild are carefully looked after by adepti living in seclusion there. These Silk Flowers feature daintier, more elegant blossoms, which puts them in stark contrast to those cultivated by horticulturalists in urban centers.\nInterestingly, the people of Liyue see the pretty and sweet-smelling Silk Flower as one of the many symbols of Rex Lapis. Which begs the question: Has this mighty and imposing god, who typically takes a decidedly masculine form on his excursions to the mortal realm, ever taken the form of a woman and accepted a ritual offering in the form of a bunch of flowers? The sparse historical records on the one hand and the plethora of rumors of obscure origin on the other means that, while this claim is more or less impossible to verify, it also cannot be simply dismissed as baseless speculation.\nOn a personal note — the writer has, on one occasion, personally witnessed a Statue of The Seven accept a carefully prepared and distinctly feminine gift that was presented to it in worship. As for the Geo Archon's innermost feelings upon receiving offerings from their subjects, however, this is not something that I, as an outsider in Liyue, consider myself qualified to comment on."},{"id":"Book173","title":"Book173","filename":"Book173_EN.txt","text":"(Test)"},{"id":"Book174","title":"Book174","filename":"Book174_EN.txt","text":"—Act I: Of Fish And Water—\nMale Role: Fan Jie\nFemale Role: Zixin\nComic Role: Grandma Zhang\n\nScene I\n(Enter Zixin wearing blue clothes)\n(Aloud)\nZixin: \"The tide reflects the mountains low, a light breeze nurtures reefs below.\"\n(Aside)\nZixin: \"I am a fisherman's daughter, I grew up by the dock.

The mountain slopes gently here, the wind is soft, and the snow is light. Added to the unfrozen water sources, it makes this place a good choice for setting up a base camp. Once I have prepared my supplies, I will make a camp here before continuing my climb to the summit.\n\nAfter setting up camp, I took the chance to survey the surrounding ruins. What intrigued me is that the architectural style and artistic patterns are strikingly similar to those seen in ancient buildings elsewhere. This could very well mean that the fabled mountain civilization of old is right beneath my feet.\nUnfortunately, I did not find any well-preserved inscriptions within the ruins, so there was no hard proof of the ancient civilization's historicity. Perhaps I will find more information is preserved further up the mountain, buried deep within the bitingly cold blizzards.\n\nSpending the night here is an unpleasant experience. The cold, damp wind chills to the bone, and the way it shakes the tent sounds like the roar of a rushing river. Guaranteed nightmare material for once you do manage to fall asleep. There's a cave by the water, and it must be spacious in there because I can hear the ghostly groaning of the wind echoing inside. Unfortunately, the entrance is tightly fenced off and there is simply no way to get through from the outside.\n\nI will start advancing further up the mountain a little later on. There are some remnants of the relatively recent past by the path, which if I'm not mistaken can be traced back to the era when Mondstadt was ruled by an aristocracy. I dug up some fragments of clothing and some irreparably damaged weaponry. The dense snow and ice seem to have slowed down the decomposition process, preserving any pieces of the past that they swallow up for a long time to come.\nThe way that the items are distributed leads me to believe that a chase once took place here on this mountain path — or possibly even a murder.\n\nIt seems that even fierce blizzards and sinister mutations pose no obstacle to humans intent on following through on their dark ambitions. In the end, this archon-forsaken snowscape has become stained by mortal transgression.\n\nAs I climb further up the path, the wind becomes stronger and the temperature plummets to an unbearably low level. I scouted out a ruin to the northeast, where to my utter astonishment I found water! It was somehow unfrozen, in defiance of its perennially blizzard-beaten surroundings. From the location, I would estimate that it is linked to the stream I saw further downhill.\nHowever, this area is so cold that I could not afford to explore deeper inside the ruin for the risk of freezing to death or drowning. I left a makeshift sign there to mark the spot — I just hope that it doesn't get buried in the snow.\nI suppose that once upon a time this could have been an underground shelter and that over the years the groundwater has seeped in and flooded it. But I have also heard that the tyrants of the distant past were partial to a form of punishment whereby they would jail a prisoner, lock them in a cage, and then slowly pour water in. Just so they could force the prisoner to watch in alarm as the water slowly rose up from their ankles to their mouth, nose, and finally their forehead...\nSuch a cruel and drawn out punishment... And in the sheer cold of this climate, it is all the more impossible to imagine that any managed to survive it.\n\nFurther to the east, the road becomes more rugged. I had a stupid accident and very nearly broke my leg because of it. I was lucky to only receive a superficial wound and no major bone injury. But it also tore a great big hole in my windproof clothing, so now I feel the full force of the wind right against my skin. It feels awful, like being stabbed constantly with a sharp knife.\nI managed to find shelter from the wind before my wound went completely numb. I just about managed to sew my clothing back up, but there's no way I can continue to the summit like this.\nI made it back to camp, finally, on the verge of freezing to death. As I warmed my feet by the bonfire, I removed my socks to find that three of my toes had turned purple from the cold... But no matter, right now I'm still enjoying the feeling of coming back to life after such a close brush with death.\n\nWhen the storm died down a little, I looked up and caught a view of the peak, towering there silently against the dark sky, encircled by giant jagged rocks and yet secluded among them in the center. The bards' songs tell of an ancient, evil dragon who lies buried there in the mountain stream — I wonder if it, too, yearns for the celestial heights even as it gazes up with its rotting and blinded eyes?\nMany villagers who live at the foot of the mountain liken this monstrous mountain to a blind spot in the eyes of the gods, a place ruled by the inscrutable force of fate. Old Mondstadt fairy tales speak of the mountain as a place of punishment that was abandoned by the Wind of Time and left for the howling winds to sweep in and freeze everything in its moment of destruction.\nYet something still stirs here, at the peak of the mountain. I heard its call in my dream. It was like a gentle song, pleasing to the ear, but somehow disturbing to the mind.\n\nThis trip was a disaster, but at least I came out of it alive. Farewell for today, Dragonspine. Perhaps I shall return, though I do not know if I will ever make it to your summit...\nI think I will explore Liyue next. But first things first, my top priority is replenishing my lost supplies.

Qilin often roam the mountain forests, but appear only on nights where starlight shines upon clear dew. For sustenance, they drink only spring water and eat only fragrant herbs.\nQilin are gentle illuminated beasts, with grace and elegance flowing through their veins. It is said that qilin will never harm living things, refusing even to step on an insect or break a blade of grass. People believe that a qilin's characteristics, behavior, and their every movement is dictated by an age-old etiquette that has remained unchanged for a thousand years.\nFollowing the barbarous age of the Archon War, many adepti became unable to continue living among the clamorous world of mortals. As a result, and under the direction of Rex Lapis, they withdrew themselves from society to live in seclusion in the bamboo groves and mountains. No longer would they interfere in the human world, content instead to enjoy a realm of mountains and water and pursue their own interests.\nYet some illuminated beasts there were that, over a thousand years of mortal cooperation, had cultivated deep friendships with ordinary humans. They decided to carry out the will of the Lord of Geo in the mortal realm, assisting human society with their adeptal powers and charity. Some hid in mountain hamlets, others walked the bustling city streets. They lived together and mixed with humankind, leaving behind unique bloodlines in Liyue Harbor.\n\nAccording to one folktale, as early as several thousand years ago, there were already those among the elegant qilin who had begun to grow deeply attached to the savage mortals.\nThe tale tells of how in that barbaric era, the people wore clothes of water lotus and bay leaf.\nOne night, a herb gatherer was bathing in a mountain pool, when to his surprise, a passing qilin began to eat the clothes that he had left by the water's edge. The illuminated beast was too young to understand human notions of shame and privacy and had yet to learn the conduct of illuminated beasts in the mortal realm.\nTo make up for her crude behavior and to avoid startling the vulnerable mortal with her otherworldly adeptal appearance, she transformed into one of human bearing. As the pale light of the full moon fell onto the pool, she appeared before the herb gatherer.\nThe young illuminated beast ultimately did not understand human notions of shame and privacy. She stood in that mountain forest, lit by cold moonlight and the glow of fireflies, clothed only in dewdrops and the lunar gleam. Together with the ignorant mortal she traveled, strolling happily among flowers and bamboo groves, revealing to him the mountain dwelling of the adepti, interpreting for him the language of the birds, sleeping lightly amid the cry of insects, sinking softly into shared and ancient dreams...\nAs the herb gatherer began to stir at the first light of dawn, he awoke to find that the noble illuminated beast had vanished without a trace.\n\nAs for how this tale unfolds, opinions vary widely. Some people say that one night, the qilin placed a bamboo basket outside the front door of the herb gatherer's home, before disappearing into the moonlit mist. When the herb gatherer came to the door, he found a child soundly asleep inside the basket.\nOthers say that from that moment on the qilin lived together with the mortal, gave birth to children, and grew accustomed to human life.\n\nNo matter the truth of the thousand-year-old matter, the elegant illuminated beasts continue to walk among the residents of Liyue, unseen among the sea of people, waiting for the day when Rex Lapis calls them forth once again."},{"id":"Book185","title":"Book185","filename":"Book185_EN.txt","text":"—Hidden Jade—\nIn the valley northwest of Liyue Harbor and south of Nantianmen lie many silent, ancient ruins.\nOne of these areas is known as the Dunyu Ruins. This area is said to have already existed even before the time of the Archon Wars.\nAccording to old legends passed by word of mouth, \"Dunyu\" means \"the land to which beauteous jade flees.\"\nIn a past beyond memory, when even Rex Lapis would still have been young, a star fell from the sky into the barren plains west of Liyue. These plains were transformed into a huge and deep chasm in the wake of that star's descent, and jade would emerge from within, beautiful and limitless, and it would become the foundation for a thousand years of industrial mining in Liyue thereafter.\nLegend has it that when that nameless star fell, a fragment of it broke off and crashed into the rocks in northern Lisha.\nAs most know, wordless stones harbored soul and spirit, and in manners and times not witnessed by mortal eyes they watched and listened to the ley lines' pulses, the echoes of the alpine springs, and the slow but inexorable movements of the mountains.\nBut unlike the ordinary but enduring stone of the earth, the fragments of the meteorite that fell from heaven had a proud and agitated temper.\n\nLater, when countless gods and rulers fought over the appointed celestial seats, and the very stars and abyss themselves faded, tragedy and evil embarred the breath of the waters and mountains. The fallen star could bear this no longer, and heedless of the great chasm's persuasions to stay it leaped away, away towards the heavens.\nAs it returned to the skies, the heavenly jade left behind a deep pit, within which humans would build great cities and mighty fortresses, finding refuge and shutting themselves in with the leftover inheritance of that fallen star.\nOver the tumult and storms of the next few thousand years, the redoubts of the Dunyu Valley stood tall and maintained prosperous relations with Liyue Harbor up till 500 years ago.\nBut with the coming of the black calamity and the rise of the Abyss, the residents of Dunyu sealed the ancient city and departed for other lands. None know why these refugees chose to shut the gates of their home, and even the millennia-old adepti and yaksha are silent on this matter.\nAnd so, the sealed fortresses became giant, silent tombs, with naught left in them but the sound of pond water and the wind whistling through empty halls — and thusly, too, did they come to be called the \"Dunyu Ruins\" by the people of Liyue."},{"id":"Book186","title":"Book186","filename":"Book186_EN.txt","text":"Due to the tragedy that befell us previously, I fear that my prior journal entries are now all but lost.\nIt is most unfortunate that the investigation notes were lost, but the conditions here are truly dangerous.\n\nAlas, we were unable to budge those great doors.\nIn the end, we returned empty-handed, with no sight of the fresco or the ancient weapons which Master Ingbert so greatly desired to see.\nUpon returning to <color=#FFE14BFF>South Base Camp</color>, there was still no sign of the others who had gone missing in the snowstorm.\nAlthough the chance may be a slim one, we can only hope that they made it down the mountain and are now returning with help and more supplies.\nIt certainly won't be long before our remaining supplies run out.\nAs cruel as it may seem to say such a thing, the cave-in that occurred just before the <color=#FFE14BFF>round door of the secret room</color> not only robbed us of Nick, but also all the food and fuel he was carrying.\nI had said that it is imperative we first check the structural integrity of these ruins...

But it was beset by troubles on every side, forcing its residents of old to flee, while the prosperity of Liyue Harbor would attract many of those who took their place. But even so, many tales of gallantry continue to circulate in these wilds.\n\nIn the tales of traveling merchants and porters, there was once a mysterious figure that would surface in the dead of night upon the plains: it was a maiden in a long indigo robe, striding along the shallows of the Bishui River, the moon wrapping her face with silver light as the night wind carried her words up to the shimmering, sleepless stars.\n\nAccording to guests at Wangshu Inn, only those who get lost amid the firefly-lights on summer nights might see her, and only those who can discern the scent of Glaze Lilies amid the dancing lights and Seelie floating in the dark could find her tracks. Some guessed that she might be a lost illuminated beast, or a sole servant of some long-dead god, gently mourning her master only at night. And some also believed her to simply be a gallant hero, like those who spurn civilization, hiding their real names.\n\nNo one knows how her story began, but it ended with the tale of a certain hunter. But unlike the stories of those merchants, the hunter encountered her brandishing a sword against several perilous shadows under the merciless moonlight. After an elegant and sharp dance, the maiden was nowhere to be seen, with naught left but a pile of bloodied dust.\nThe next day, some inquisitive citizens would discover the corpses of Millelith and land surveyors by the river.\nAfter this, no matter how many search parties the Ministry of Civil Affairs would send, no one saw that riverside maiden ever again.\n\nPerhaps that deadly dance was the fruit of some vendetta, or perhaps that woman had herself been some great brigand.

Good/Very good. 2. Casual affirmation when conversing, such as, \"Ah, okay.\" 3. Very, completely, most.\nNote: \"Dada upa\" means \"very tall/large mountain.\"\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Ika ya/Ika yaya/Ya ika/Yaya ika\"</color>\n1. A bad person/Bad people!\nNote: If you hear hilichurls shout these words and you are confident in yourself, give them a wallop. Otherwise, run.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Muhe\"</color>\n1. Like, want.\nNote: You will not generally hear hilichurls say that they like you, so translating this as \"want\" is sufficient.\n\nUseful Phrases:\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Gusha\"</color>\n1. Vegetables, grasses, fruits. Disliked things.\nNote: Aside from eating plants, \"mosi gusha\" can also express unhappiness.\nIf a hilichurl says \"Gusha\" to you, you must use their tone of voice to determine if they want fruits, rice, or wheat, or if they are dissatisfied.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Mita\"</color>\n1. Meat, delicious foods. Liked items.\nNote: \"In movo lata mita / Mita in movo lata / Mita movo lata\" refers to \"meat in the water\" — I believe that even you can figure that one out, little Ella.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Upano\"</color>\n1. Difficult to explain, please see note.\nNote: This word is affixed to nouns and describes an upper direction, height, or flight. It can indicate flying insects, birds, clouds, patrolling knights, a small companion sent flying by a larger hilichurl. In short, this word is difficult to explain.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Celi\"</color>\n1. Hot. Something that is hot. Fire.\n2. Occasionally \"sun\"; \"Celi upa\" without \"upa\" can also mean \"sun.\"\nNote: \"Celi lata\" is an unusual figure of speech as it implies both cold and heat.\nThis phrase generally refers to things that emit light but not heat. For example, \"Celi lata gusha\" is \"Small Lamp Grass,\"\nAnd \"Celi lata\" can describe things such as fireflies, stars, or the moon.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Kucha gusha/Unu gusha\"</color>\n1. Seed.\nNote: It may be hard to believe that I would list such a word. Hilichurls do not specifically practice farming, but they have a habit of stockpiling seeds. Sometimes when they are in a good mood, they will find a place and bury their seeds. \"Kucha\" means \"small,\" and carries a slightly contemptuous connotation in Hilichurlian. \"Unu\" is the number \"one\" and is a holy word that embodies the hilichurls' concept of gods and the origin of life. Both of these terms can be used to describe a seed, which is fascinating.\nBy the way, \"Du\" is two, \"Unu du\" is three, and \"Dudu\" is four. Can you guess what five is?\nThe correct answer is \"Mani,\" which also means \"hands\" or \"physical labor.\"\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Sada\"</color>\n1. Solid, hard.\nNote: In Hilichurlian, \"Upa sada\" means that you are prepared to do something.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Boya\"</color>\n1. Used with certain words to denote colors.\nNote: According to my tests, \"Celi boya\" is red, \"Gusha boya\" is green, \"Lata boya\" is blue, \"Nini boya\" is white, \"Nunu boya/Sama boya\" are black, and \"Unu boya\" is yellow.\n\nTime and Directions:\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Aba mosi dada\"</color>\n1. From waking until lunch.\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Unta mosi dada\"</color>\n1. The wonderful time from lunch till just before sunset.\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Mosi aba nunu\"</color>\n1. From after sunset until late night.\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Unta nunu\"</color>\n1. Late night.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Du ya zido dala?\"</color>\n1. Where did this thing go?\nNote: After some thought, I have decided to omit Hilichurlian directional words from this handbook. Hilichurls do not have absolute directions, so their directional speech is relative. However, the subject in their responses depends on their attitude towards you. If they like you, they will speak from your point of view. If not, they will use themselves as the frame of reference.\nThe most recommended method is to obtain a map, ask them this question, and have them identify the location on the map."},{"id":"Book198","title":"Book198","filename":"Book198_EN.txt","text":"\"Though the front half was lost, we've somehow managed to stay afloat on the remaining back half for some time now...

She rents a shop there that sells alcohol and lives a leisurely existence.\n\nI say \"leisurely.\" That's putting it nicely. \"Completely and utterly chaotic\" would be a more accurate description.\n\nIn theory, someone who enjoys alcohol enough to start a business selling it should know a thing or two about it. This applies as much to youkai as to humans.\nBut to be absolutely blunt, Yoichi has terrible taste in alcohol and has no business sense at all. Worst of all, in all her days in the human realm, she has never ridden herself of her awful tengu habits. Sometimes she will get drunk and stir up trouble among other youkai or kidnap human children and parade around all night at the festival, causing total chaos. Other times, she will barge into a theater, with no regard for the atmosphere, then casually strut on stage and start beating up the lead actor... the list goes on.\nIf it weren't for her senior status among the youkai and her extensive connections in human society, I suspect Yoichi might have been dealt with by some hero or other at the foot of a mountain long ago.\nBut the youkai and human folk of Toki Alley see her quite differently. Even the Great Gongen has never given her serious punishment, because she has never caused any major trouble.\n\nThough haughty and slovenly by nature, as a \"great youkai, set apart from the common folk\" (her own words), Yoichi isn't greatly attached to worldly possessions. Any money she comes into is spent swiftly on alcohol — or else on novels from Yae Publishing House, which she skims through halfway before promptly defenestrating them. As a result, her home is not what you would call \"domesticated\" — quite the opposite, in fact.\n\nSimply put, she doesn't have any worldly possessions of sentimental value... the sole exception being the golden paper fan she wears on her waist.\n\nThe Great Tengu are a race of monsters that travels to many different worlds, and it's not at all uncommon for them to adorn themselves with battle trophies that have an interesting backstory. Such is the case for this paper fan.\nOn a moonlit night, a drunken Yoichi, her shirt collar wide open, began bragging to me about its story...\n\nShe said that in one of the many worlds she had traversed, she took the form of a haughty young male archer, serving under an equally haughty shogun. Under that shogun's command, she, — or rather, \"he\" — had proudly shot down countless opponents, including big-bellied mortal samurai and crafty tanuki ninjas. Even the jikininki, despite their bulky figures, were no match against a single shot from Yoichi's bow.\n\n\"Hahahahaha! You are truly a great soldier! Your vision is keen like lightning, just like the Great Tengu!\"\nAt that age, the conceited shogun tended to laugh in a loud and obnoxious manner, which was most unseemly.\nAfter that, Yoichi made numerous contributions for the shogun, executing many monsters and unfortunate mortals. It goes without saying that she probably made some of the stories up. But what she truly became renowned for was the final battle of that world, a world in which she spent a hundred years.\n\nIn that naval battle, the shogun and rebels braved storms to fight bloody battles between the straits. The monsters numbered at least eight million, maybe eight million more than that, while the mortal samurai must have numbered in the tens of millions. In terms of casualties, the headcount cannot be known, but what is known is that 800 thousand ships sank in the course of the battle. Yoichi reached this staggering tally with my assistance as she was vomiting up a bellyfull of wine by the window.\n\nAs is typical of so many stories about bitterly fought wars stuck in stalemate, brave heroes from both sides mowed down their enemies like blades of grass, painting the sea blood-red, while the rival generals stubbornly refused to back down, preferring to stay locked in intransigence than to withdraw their troops and head home to get a good night's sleep.\n\nFinally, on one cold moonlit night, a small boat slowly floated out from enemy lines. A lone figure stood on the boat, swaying like a reflection in the water. Beside the figure was a shimmering flagpole with a paper fan at the top. It gave off a golden glow in the moonlight.\n\n\"Argh, ARGH... I am furious, furious! This blatant provocation cannot be tolerated!\"\nThe shogun squinted his eyes, saw the golden fan in the distance, and instantly flew into a rage.\n\nYoichi couldn't understand why the shogun's self-esteem was so fragile, but was too lazy to empathize with the petty mortal sense of dignity. At that moment, she... no, \"he,\" fixed his keen tengu gaze on the floating figure in the boat.\n\nWhat he saw was a woman, and an altogether different one than Yoichi.\n\nMoments later, a single arrow flew across the moon and tore apart the night sky.\n\n\"Haha, great!\"\nSoon, the shogun's shouting was drowned out by the cheers of the army.\n\n\"If those two old-timers find out what they have lost, they'd probably be so angry they'd rupture their spleens!\"\nYoichi let out a conceited and mischievous laugh. She was drunk. The Great Tengu had a certain twinkle in her eye, of the rather repulsive variety, that she made no attempt to cover up.\n\nWhat had happened was that as the arrow flew through the air, Yoichi had already spread out her giant wings and flown across the strait, snatching the golden paper fan and the bewildered beauty holding onto it as she passed over the boat. She then took the opportunity to push over the insufferably loud-mouthed shogun and flew away from the battle.\nA perfect tengu snatch and grab.\nIt was just a shame that...\n\"Well, you know what happened, she was a neko. She scratched me to pieces...\"\nYoichi stuck out her tongue and sighed with exasperation.\n\n\"Oh right, it's snapper season! You should take some back with you.\"\n\"Hmm? The stingy Great Tengu has a heart?\"\n\"I meant for that woman!\"\nSeeing the threatening gaze from the greatly tipsy Great Tengu, I hastily gathered the remaining snapper in my arms and left."},{"id":"Book209","title":"Book209","filename":"Book209_EN.txt","text":"Osen's Tale\n\nI left Yoichi's house and followed the winding alley for a while, then turned into a narrow street to arrive at that old lady's home.\nWhen the night is pitch black and the moon has climbed to its peak, the neko awaken from their slumber.\nIt is said that neko who have lived up for hundreds or even thousand of years can easily take on the form of a young woman, tempting people into doing funny and foolish things or chasing innocent travelers out of some sense of spiteful vengeance. But that's just the stuff of mortal imagination.\nIn fact, the bake-neko only take on the form of young women when they're especially angry. Most of the time, they prefer to take on the form of an older woman, partly because it matches their crafty and cantankerous nature, but also because they can use old age as a disguise, portraying themselves as gentle souls to poor, unsuspecting passers-by.\n\n\"Hey, that's not free!\"\nAt the sound of the voice, I raised my head to see a young woman sitting on the eaves, as if she'd been waiting there for a while. Her face was obscured in the shadows, and all I could make out was something resembling a smile on her face and the golden-green light reflected by her eyes. Moonlight flowed from her semi-exposed shoulders down her dress, trickling through the gaps in the hem of her skirt and outlining her long, slender legs with a porcelain-white luster. She was absent-mindedly playing with a kendama in her hand.\n\nYep, the old lady was definitely furious...\n\n\"Tut-tut, you're late again tonight.\"\n\"Of course, s—sorry.\"\n\nMosquitoes kept bumping into the paper lamp, causing it to flicker lethargically in response.\nAs the moon shone down, a humid wind arose. Before long, it had brought the cicadas' cries to a stop.\n\nWith her hair flowing down, the lady turned the spinning wheel with a perverse smile on her face. It was quite terrifying.\nNow, despite my being a tanuki on friendly-enough terms with the tengu to sit and drink with them, even I have to be on my very best behavior around the bake-neko. So, I promptly prostrated myself and apologized profusely for my transgression.\n\n\"Never mind, never mind. Since the snapper is still fresh, you can get up.\"\nWith great difficulty on account of my rotund tanuki form, I resumed a normal seated position. The young woman slowly transformed back into an old woman, who had a kindly but strange smile on her face.\n\"Thank you, Auntie Sen.\"\nCall me Osen!\n\nI was relieved.\nBut something still felt off.\n\n\"Hahahaha, anyway, how's that fool doing these days?\"\nWith a slurp, Osen swallowed one of the fish whole, including the tail.\n\nAs for the story of how her fate became intertwined with that of the Great Tengu, the facts can only be described as farcical. We have already heard the ridiculous tale from Yoichi's perspective, but the bake-neko tells a completely different story.\n\nOsen wasn't born in our world, but in one where mortals were much more savage.\nOne night, in a bamboo forest, the young Osen was captured by a wandering monk. After passing through many hands, she was eventually sold to the shogun and became some sort of \"Obake-Neko.\"\nShe has few memories of those days beyond wondering why the high-ranking officials of the mortal world enjoyed annoying her and playing with her. Every day, she was driven to scratch her enemies to pieces, or forced to play boring games which only they seemed to enjoy.\nThis went on for such a long time that any normal person would have been driven to madness. But youkai live such long lives that they have far more patience than mortals.\n\nLater, when her shogun and the rebels' shogun started fighting, Osen transformed into a ninja.\n\n\"This is where the story gets even more boring...\"\nOsen squinted her eyes as she said this, letting out a huge yawn that stretched from ear to ear.\n\nOn the night of that naval battle, the shogun thought of an ingenious scheme...\nThe shogun ordered Osen to transform into a beautiful young woman and stand on a small boat with a golden fan to humiliate the rebels so that they dare not approach. Even if they did, the bake-neko would teach them a brutal lesson.\n\nBut of course, Yoichi was standing amidst the ranks of the rebels...\n\"But of course, that fool suddenly stood up and starting ranting and raving about shooting down the fan with a single arrow.\"\nThen, the Great Tengu...\n\"...Slipped and fell, landing in the ocean with a great big splash.\"\nThe old woman's feline face failed to stifle a smile, and erupted into jeering laughter.\n\n\"She was so drunk that night that she thought the seas were the stormiest she'd ever seen. In fact, the moon shone calmly and coolly, and there was not a trace of wind.\"\n\"But, it'd been a few hundred years since I'd seen someone so entertaining. So, to save her the humiliation, I stifled my laughter and took the paper fan down myself... Then, a roar of cheers came from their fleet. Just thinking about it amuses me to this day...\"\n\nNext, the Great Tengu unfurled her gigantic wings and leaped into the air, like a cloud covering the moon, and swooped down towards the beautiful woman...\n\"A flurry of arrows later, and she fell into the sea looking like a hedgehog. I couldn't keep a straight face any longer and started laughing uncontrollably.\"\nLaughing raucously, Osen dragged the ill-fated tengu from the sea, put her in a headlock, and flew over the fleets from both sides, laughing manically and causing both generals to lose their tempers.\nPeople say she flew over eight ships in an row, then disappeared into the night. The feline youkai's laughter could be heard for more than three days after the battle had finished.\n\n\"I couldn't stop laughing, so I scratched her as hard as I could... But the sorry state she was in made me laugh even harder, and the harder I scratched, the harder I laughed, hahahahaha...\"\nThe neko transformed into an old lady and laughed uncontrollably.\n\n\"Afterwards, she brought me to this world and treated me like I was some kind of trophy!\"\nThe old woman pursed her lips as her face transformed into that of a sulky young woman. But this looked quite comical, because her cheeks were still flushed bright red from having laughed so hard she could barely breathe.\n\"I am NOT a trophy!\"\n\n\"Hmm, now I think about it, that's probably the whole reason why she doesn't dare to visit me herself.\"\nThe elderly female with feline features and the face of a young woman sighed gently, then smiled a cunning smile once more.\n\n\"You should go. Leave the door open, and come back on the next full moon.\"\n\"Also, don't forget to take this raincoat over to our old friend.\""},{"id":"Book20","title":"Book20","filename":"Book20_EN.txt","text":"—Ballad Selection Excerpt—\n\"Breeze Amidst the Forest\" and \"Breeze Upon the Lake\" constitute a two-volume collection of narrative poems.

I, for one, cannot fathom it. The dragon decided to stay with the bard, for he too wished to be understood by all souls. He learned human speech and the Windborne Bard's singing techniques.\n...omitted...\nLater generations regarded him as one of the Four Winds that watched over and protected Mondstadt.\n\n\"An atrous sun befell its kingdom and a luminous pearl lost its glow.\"\n\"Niveous silk grew dim and wheaten gold burned brilliantly no more.\"\nSo begins another tale that occurred in the lost Khaenri'ah Kingdom.\nThe Eclipse Dynasty had fallen, and disaster spread across the land. The alchemist known as Gold was corrupted by their own greed and ambition, and created an army of shadowy monsters with their uncanny powers. Durin, a black serpentine dragon, rose from the sea to cast its shadow over Mondstadt. But it was at this very moment that there was no one to inherit the title of Lionfang Knight, thus, the Knights of Favonius could not fly their falcon flag.\nThe persistent yet despondent prayers called upon the archon of Mondstadt, the Windborne Bard. The strings of the lyre were strummed once more, and the Wind Dragon was summoned forth.\nAs Mondstadt's last line of defense, the Wind Dragon battled the wicked dragon to the death in the raging storms.\nThe Wind Dragon prevailed. He tore open the throat of the wicked dragon, at the cost of ingesting its poisonous blood. The blood of the wicked dragon was distorted gold, with the powers to crumble mountains and poison the earth.\nThe Wind Dragon protected Mondstadt with his life, and his only wish was to be understood by humans. And so, he drifted off into a deep slumber.\nThe Holy Lyre played a sorrowful tune.\nThe Holy Lyre sang: should you awaken, spread your wings and live your life freely! A dragon is born to soar the skies, and mortals shall surely grasp your beauty...\n\n(*Typically, when life arises from the elements, it either descends and becomes a slime, or ascends and becomes a crystalfly.

There was only the quiet trickle of water droplets in the suikinkutsu, accompanied by the rhythmic thumps of the shishi-odoshi.\nLong ago, in the mountains and forests where youkai could lead carefree lives, the lady who could turn mist into rain was a good friend of the tanuki and kitsune.\nNaturally, us youkai are vastly different from mortals. We don't have complicated troubles that plague us, nor do we have things like status or class. But in the mountains shrouded in mist and rain, the soft-spoken Ameonna always managed to gain more respect and adoration.\nIt was later, when everyone had submitted to the Great Gongen. Good times came for mortals, and youkai either lived in seclusion at various places, or were subjected to destruction and suppression... It was then that Granny Ame moved to Toki Alley. As a token of sympathy, the Kitsune of Grand Narukami Shrine, Lady Guuji, gave her this mansion.\nWhat kind of loss and sorrow led to Lady Guuji taking special care of Granny Ame? I'm really curious.\n\nStopping briefly in the courtyard, I watched the crescent moon swaying in the pond, as her voice rang gently in the cool night breeze.\n\n\"My apologies to have kept you waiting for so long.\"\nWhen I turned around, I saw Ameonna standing by the door. She was bathed in pale moonlight, her long white dress shone with a dewy sheen, but her young and slender figure exuded a melancholic aura of a bygone era.\n\nSo, I looked down and hastily handed over the raincoat that Osen passed to me, not daring to look directly into her pale gray eyes.\nIt is rumored among mortals that the eyes of the sorrowful Ameonna will take on the marble gray-white hue of a drowning person. Those who dare to look directly into these woeful eyes will be lost forever in the incomprehensible fog of rain.\nOf course, that's just a silly legend among mortals, but the basic etiquette like \"Don't look into the eyes of the sorrowful Ameonna\" is indeed an unwritten rule among youkai.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\nGranny Ame's voice was as soft and gentle as ever, like morning dew in the mist.\n\nShe didn't invite me in, nor did she share her story.\nAll I was handed was a wooden box, but that's all I needed to know.\nSo, while the moon was bright, I quietly left the courtyard."},{"id":"Book211","title":"Book211","filename":"Book211_EN.txt","text":"The Tale of Gonbei\n\nGonbei is 76 years old and is the only mortal living in Toki Alley.\nHe was a farmer, a samurai, and a craftsman.\nThe box in my hand is his handiwork, its smooth black lacquer surface inlaid with an iridescent mother-of-pearl.

On their way, they had been scammed by a Lavender Melon seller from the village: He had offered them a few melons to quench their thirst, ostensibly out of the goodness of his heart, before then insisting that they purchase more of his melons at an extortionate price. But touring musicians aren't exactly wealthy, and they couldn't afford to spend the entirety of their budget for the return trip on overpriced melons...\nThe Twin Oni of Tokaku are an impulsive pair. Upon hearing the story, they instantly began fuming with rage, and unanimously decided that they needed to teach this dishonest merchant a lesson by cutting him into tiny pieces.

But with peace having prevailed in Inazuma for so long, his sword skills offered no further use, so he became a merchant in the village instead. After learning a few swindler's tricks, such as extortion, intimidation, and judicious use of his fierce appearance, no one dared confront him no matter how much he took from them. Over time, he had become one of the wealthiest people in the village.\n\nOn this day, Dozaemon was relaxing in front of his shop when all of a sudden, he saw dust flying and felt the ground shaking. Then, a shadow large enough to dwarf his shop slowly fell over his face.\n\n\"Hey! I want to buy some melons!\"\n\nDozaemon narrowed his eyes and sized up the muscular, fierce-looking, and ill-mannered customer standing over him like an executioner, before finally realizing — oh, she's a woman...!\n\n\"How many?\"\n\nApparently, this customer was in no hurry to answer. She was too busy admiring his wakizashi, which was lying on the chopping board:\n\n\"Mighty fine blade you got there.\"\n\n\"You got that right. I'll have you know I'm from a samurai clan. It's only fitting that I keep an heirloom nearby.\"\n\nDozaemon went along with the conversation, unaware of where it was heading.\n\n\"Shame. It's wasted on chopping melons.\"\n\nDozaemon sensed that this was an intentionally barbed remark, and he did not look happy about it:\n\n\"What's with all the chit-chat? Are you buying melons or not?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am, I am.\"\n\nItaru smiled at Dozaemon as a gesture of apology.\n\n\"Four pounds of chopped Lavender Melon, without the skins, please.\"\n\nDozaemon's suspicions were aroused, but he did not question the request. He promptly chopped four pounds of melon and placed it onto the scale.\n\n\"Hey, how come your scale's all wonky?\"\n\nDozaemon grasped his blade the moment Itaru said this.\n\n\"Well, isn't that something — this scale's got a mind of its own!\"\n\n\"Glad you're so amused. But it's time to pay up now.\"\n\nDozaemon could no longer hold back his anger. The time for pleasantries was over — it was time to talk sense.\n\n\"Heh, I don't have a problem with paying you what you're due... I'm just not sure you'd be able to take it.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't you worry — I'll take whatever you've got to give!\"\n\n\"You sure about that!?\"\n\n\"Try me!\"\n\nSuddenly, Itaru yelled \"take this!\" and threw a bag full of Mora directly at Dozaemon's face. Dozaemon didn't react in time, and took the full force of the impact square on the nose. He fell backwards onto the ground as his precious wakizashi went flying from his hand and fell beside him. On closer inspection, his nose had been squashed completely flat by the bag of Mora: It looked just like the kind of pouch one might use to store a pipe, only without the pipe inside.\n\nItaru walked over and pressed her foot down on the dishonest merchant's chest. Without a word, she hit Dozaemon so hard it felt like a Liyue martial arts tournament was being hosted on his face. With great difficulty, he fought to get back on his feet, but just as he had stood up and grabbed his blade, Itaru noticed and landed another ferocious blow to his head. This time, it hit so hard that a pair of tanuki ears popped out in response. He began to beg for mercy.\n\nItaru burst out laughing at the sight in front of her. So, the merchant is a youkai in disguise — and a filthy tanuki at that!\n\nItaru promptly confiscated the tanuki's stolen wakizashi, distributed most of its ill-gotten wealth among the villagers, and handed the rest to the mother and daughter who had fallen victim to its scheme earlier.

There are so many things I want to say to you, yet my pen falls idle whenever I attempt to start this letter. We learned martial arts together since we were young, and enlisted once we were older. We did everything together. You're like a real brother to me. I never thought that we'd have such a big argument, or that we'd even come to blows over that disagreement.\nKenji, my brother, I regret what I did every moment of every day. If I had been more calm and not been so insistent on leaving, you might not have been as furious as you were. You must think of me as a shameless deserter who has betrayed the Shogun, and that's why you raised a hand against me without letting me explain. I care not about what everyone thinks of me — everyone but you. And that is why I have to write this letter, to tell you how I really feel.\nRemember the dreams we shared when we first enlisted? We wanted to show our bravery and swordsmanship to make a name for ourselves and take care of our parents in this time of chaos. We were taught that it was a major offense that the people of Sangonomiya had dared to draw their swords against the Electro Mitsudomoe banner. We were told to end their lives with no reservation, as it was they who chose the path of death. I used to truly believe that. But after that incident, I find that I no longer can.\nA battle had just ended at the time. As we withdrew, I found a bloodied letter belonging to a rebel soldier. You may not believe it, but we both know that soldier. When we first enlisted, there was a senior who looked after me for quite a while. That letter is his. In that letter, he wrote that he missed the fishing boat back home, and that he looked forward on returning after the war is over. I never would've thought that he would join the rebels, and that I would meet him on the battlefield under such circumstances.\nEver since my finding that letter, I suddenly came to realize that the rebels are people too. They too have parents they need to take care of, and a home to return to. I then decided to keep the incident of the letter to myself, and hoped to send it back to our senior's family. However, a number of our comrades somehow found out about the incident, and I was treated with ridicule and hostility. You and I come from low birth, yet we were able to quickly rise to the rank of Hatamoto through our hard work and abilities. This has caused many to spread rumors behind our backs. After this incident, the isolation and hostility became worse. It got so bad that our comrades would expose my back to the enemy while we were on the battlefield. I barely escaped death on numerous occasions. Everything that happened has made my heart grow chill. After thinking upon it for a very long time, I decided that if I've been forsaken by my comrades in the Shogunate, and that deep down inside I've developed empathy for my enemies, maybe I should just join them.\nKenji, you've always been the straightforward and magnanimous one between us. You've never noticed the things that were going on. My telling you of the incidents that took place is not to ask for you to understand, but merely to know what it is that's going on in my mind. I am writing to you from the Sangonomiya camp right now, and I hope that the war would have already ended by the time you read this letter. And when that time comes, if you are willing to accept me as your friend once more, we can return home together, just as we had previously planned.

It was built to honor Barbatos the Anemo Archon in name, yet in reality it was nothing more than a flamboyant display of wealth and power by the royals to gloat over the commoners. The one time in the year that the commoners living in these dark times could find a little solace was during Ludi Harpastum.\nDuring one Ludi Harpastum, a wandering singer from a distant land arrived in the city. The name of the lass was Inès, and everyone at the festival was enchanted by her stunning beauty. People of all ages and all walks of life vied to catch a glimpse of her throwing the Harpastum and to hear her sing foreign ballads.\n\n\"The blessings of Barbatos are for everyone! You are only sinful if you are bitter at such a joyous occasion!\"\n\nAs she sang these verses, she handed out her earnings during the festival to the poor and orphans in the city.\nA frail figure stood among the crowds. He was the Seneschal, and he fell for her at first sight. But his religious piety filled him with a frustration at his inability to suppress the emotions he was experiencing, and her acts of charity, which violated the Church's right to aid to the poor, irked him all the more.\nAs is known to all, the beliefs of contemporary Mondstadters hold that the Anemo Archon Barbatos encourages people to seek love and pursue freedom, but in the dark ages the Anemo Archon slept, and the city was tormented by the tyranny of the nobles, the poverty of the commoners, and the ravage of the dragon; meanwhile, the self-proclaimed \"orthodox\" church — a mere figurehead, controlled by the ruling class — advocated abstinence from earthly pleasures to avert divine punishment. Under such circumstances, even the harp which symbolized the wind had been restricted to playing only those songs deemed \"holy.\" However, the notion of \"divine punishment\" was little more than an excuse fabricated by the nobles to conceal their avarice and restrict the commoners.\n\n\"To let her stay in the city is to bewitch all its inhabitants. What wickedness will this witch bring?\" The Seneschal pondered.\n\nAnd so, the Seneschal plotted to hunt down Inès, and to confine her to the Cathedral while awaiting further instructions. As per the traditions of the time, the maiden chosen to throw the Harpastum should serve at the royal court for three days after the celebration, under the protection of the aristocrats. The Seneschal decided to send his adopted son, Octave, to sneak into the royal court and abduct Inès.\nOctave was an unwelcome child, abandoned by his superstitious parents at birth and later raised by the Seneschal. As a child, he was persecuted and abused by the citizens, seen as a bad omen of draconic disasters. The only person who protected Octave was the Seneschal, who treated him like his own son and thus won his utmost trust.\n\n\"Bring the maiden who threw the Harpastum yesterday to me! Disturb no one and do not mention my name.\"\n\nUnder orders from the Seneschal, Octave climbed onto the balcony of the court chambers at nightfall. Upon seeing the girl weeping in the moonlight, his pure heart was stirred, for he had never seen such a wondrous sight. He gazed at the girl, leaving his task forgotten.\nBut the silence of the tranquil moment shared by Octave and the girl was interrupted by the servants..."},{"id":"Book28","title":"Book28","filename":"Book28_EN.txt","text":"—The Dragon—\nAn excerpt from \"An Investigation into the Cultural Customs of the Wind Kingdom,\" more commonly known as \"Records of Customs and Culture,\" by Jacob Musk.\n\n...\nThe \"Wolf\" of the Knight of Boreas, the \"Lion\" of the Lionfang Knight (or \"Dandelion Knight\"), the \"Falcon\" of the Knights of Favonius, and the \"Wind Dragon\" Dvalin have been long regarded as the Four Winds that watch over Mondstadt.\nAfter the Lionfang Knight liberated Mondstadt, the Knights of Favonius was established, and the Knight of Boreas joined them. The tradition of worshiping the Four Winds was gradually formed in Mondstadt.

The Lionfang Knight was without a suitable heir, and the Knights of Favonius had lost many of its brave men and women during the bitter wars. During the most difficult of times, Durin, the corrupted dragon of immeasurable power, began attacking Mondstadt.\nThe prayers of Mondstadt's people awoke the Anemo Archon, and his will summoned forth the Wind Dragon Dvalin. As the last defender of Mondstadt, Dvalin battled Durin with all his might.\nThe result was clear — Durin's remains still lie atop the snowy peaks to the south of Mondstadt — but the story of how the battle ended was lost in time. It is said that Dvalin ripped out Durin's throat, and together they fell from the sky. Durin's body sunk into the snow while Dvalin was summoned by the Anemo Archon and fell into a slumber.\n...\nPeople used to believe that Dvalin would awaken whenever Mondstadt faces a new threat.\nBut in these times of peace, the belief of the Four Winds has gradually eroded and their temples lie all but completely deserted.\n\n(Citation of unknown origin: By the time the Knights finally discovered that the foreign monstrosity named Stormterror, with which they had clashed countless times, was in fact Dvalin of the Four Winds, the enmity that had grown between them and driven them to conflict could not be undone.

Its battle strength is around thirty.\nIn a distant causality, if the philosopher Zarathustra was not chosen, then the opera writer would have gained victory in the contest over the will of the world.\nOnce Gesamtkunstwerk takes the stage in the opera theater of the apocalypse, many more Beasts of the World that reside within the center of the universe will inexorably begin to appear as well.\nIn the final volume, the weakness of the Beast of the World: Saint of Seven Tears (whose combat strength was ten, and therefore equal to Fischl) was quite out of the ordinary, and the Saint merely wept for Zarathustra at first, a choice that seems undeserving of any blame.\nBoth Zarathustra and The Musician exist to give praise unto the Prinzessin der Verurteilung. One proclaims the agony she suffers in her heart, while the other proclaims the grandeur of her travails. The Prinzessin, of course, will not favor the latter, for of such things would she be ashamed.\n\nSommernachtgarten\nIt is said that those who are highly-skilled in the magical arts will possess their own unique domains of consciousness. Their loves, hatreds, yearnings, jealousies, adherence, and passions of the soul will be stored here. In the fictional tales of other novels, this space is called Summerland.\nThe Sommernachtgarten of the Prinzessin is something in this vein. That this concept was never well-explored in the end remains quite the pity.\n\nThe Suspected Eternal Return\nQuite a few of the finer points of the tale have caused people to wonder if the Kaiserin of the Immernachtreich once experienced all that Fischl has.\nFischl's father is undoubtedly not a mere shade. He is majestic and mighty, and helps Fischl to dispel her confusions. As for Fischl's mother, the Kaiserin, her actions and deeds show her to have quite an interesting character indeed. But she will only speak one line, which is, as was noted earlier in this text, \"the dream lives on.\"\nIn the final volume, Fischl's mother had already faded away, and so this volume, naturally, did not have this preceding line.\nBut as the universe entered its denouement and all things within it flowed into the Immernachtreich, she spoke another line of enigmatic intent—\n\"Find meaning somewhere. The night deepens...\"\n\n\"Find meaning somewhere. The night deepens, but the dream lives on.\"\nDear readers, I hope that you will all find happiness in this world where the sun still rises each day.\n\nCollection of Questions and Answers\nQ: Dear Mr. Nine, may I ask what the relationship between the Celestial Emperor's daughter in \"Legend of the Shattered Halberd\" and Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort is?\nA: I felt that the tragedy that unfolded toward the end of Volume 5 of \"Legend of the Shattered Halberd\" was due to the male protagonist, and the Celestial Emperor's daughter's attraction to him. As such, I wanted to write a Prinzessin der Verurteilung who had no need of a male protagonist. This was the scaffold that would come to be \"Flowers for Princess Fischl.\"\nEventually, though, I did write the sixth volume of \"Halberd,\" which rescued the ending. There was probably some cross-pollination in the process of writing two series at the same time, but I was personally quite pleased with the result.\n\nQ: In a fight between Mir's dad (Khan the Asura and his sword Laevatain) at full strength versus Gesamtkunstwerk, who would come out on top?\nA: I originally intended to refuse to answer this question, but the editor-in-chief said that she'd axe my next manuscript if I didn't. In which case, my Mora would be on Gesamtkunstwerk.\n\nQ: Mr. Nine, you mentioned in \"Farewell Frau Welt\" that you were suffering from hair loss. Are you doing better now?\nA: Could the Yae Publishing House not accept this sort of question? And do people actually read what gets added in these new editions?\n(Editor-in-Chief's Note: Oh, but the readers are very concerned about you! And yes, they are also very concerned with the purchase of new editions.)"},{"id":"Book298","title":"Book298","filename":"Book298_EN.txt","text":"???"},{"id":"Book299","title":"Book299","filename":"Book299_EN.txt","text":"???"},{"id":"Book29","title":"Book29","filename":"Book29_EN.txt","text":"In the distant past, the Night Mother ruled over the faraway Land of Night.

Yougou\nLush sakura trees grow all over this mountain on the northern end of Narukami Island. These sakura all share roots with the largest of them, the Sacred Sakura, which sits on the mountain's summit.\nThe Grand Narukami Shrine, greatest of the Inazuman shrines, is dedicated to this Sacred Sakura.\nLittle Yae has been the one managing the shrine in recent years. Ah, how she's grown! It's just a shame, really, to think that I can never again make her cry as easily as I used to.\nReally, I'd thought that she'd quickly get drunk, start to cry, and start talking all silly, but she drank me under the table instead... I made a fool of myself in the process and was quite thoroughly mocked for it. Getting made out to be some old woman who got what was coming to her... Bah.\n...And here I was looking to tease that little girl a bit more, too.\n\nInazuma City\nI brought a new firework formula to that Naganohara kid's place. But when he heard me talking about a new medicine that might cure his deafness, he demurred and did not accept it.\nThis kid is ever the conservative about explosives, always diluting them to the point where they cannot cause any obvious physical changes to the environment, and always relying on the combustion of different metals to produce monotonous visual effects.\nAnd he only does tests inside his workshop! I mean, come on, where's the fun in that?\nAh, such a waste, such a waste!\n\nNow as for his daughter, Yoimiya, she's an interesting young lady. We collected a lot of sweets during the festival and tried all kinds of new formulae out. That was so much fun!\n...And then we got packed off to a deserted beach by the fire brigade. Something about new rules with which to keep the peace in Inazuma City, or something similarly silly.\n\nWe discussed a lot of new ideas, and she even gave me some constructive feedback. A talented kid, this one is. If the paradise I made for Klee also had one of Yoimiya's fireworks performances, that would have been perfect!\nIt's just a shame that that grumpy general kept too close an eye on us — or else I'd have helped Yoimiya improve some of her gadgets, or even spirited her away.\nThis reminds me of the time, not long ago, when I was preparing a medicine that would allow for flight in the Imperial Kitchen. It blew up due to a mistake of mine, injuring a young tengu warrior to the point where her left wing would have needed, say, half a month to recover. I had wanted to help her patch the wound up, but it seems as if she's been avoiding me ever since...\nWell, I left her some medicine all the same, just to see how its effects would turn out.\nAfter that incident, it seems that person who spends all her time holed up in Tenshukaku has sent some soldiers specifically to watch my every move. I mean, that's a bit much.\nI even apologized right to her face, but she just won't let up.\nShe was the one who'd allowed me to conduct experiments in the Imperial Kitchen in the first place, you know?\n\nAlso, Ms. Kamisato declined my idol group invitation for the sixth time running. Ah, what a disappointment.\n\nTatarasuna\nTatarasuna is an island chain that is naturally shaped like a ring. The mountains rise to overlook the sea, surrounding the large blast furnace in the middle. This is where Inazuman Jade Steel is produced and endlessly made into the best weaponry for the highfalutin bigwigs of Inazuma — ore made from the blood and bones of a defeated god.\nThis place is the Tenryou Commissioner's pride and joy, and as such, he takes extra good care of the workers and technical specialists.\nI was accompanied during my time at Tatarasuna by a lady named Kagami Gozen. She seems to be a leader amongst the workers there, and has an official Shogunate post. Even though she's the Tenryou Commissioner's subordinate, she very much looks like his equal in front of the workers.\nAll of them trust and love her. I'd daresay that their respect for her dispatches might be even greater than what they give the Shogun... But Kagami Gozen herself frowns often. Very unfriendly-looking.\n\nThe Tatarasuna workers are largely rootless, washed up on these shores by the waves of history. Their many tattoos and working songs set them apart, but also strengthen their mutual bonds.\n\nLike the other workers at Tatarasuna, Kagami Gozen's body has scars from high-temperature burns from Tatarigami. These may be signs of short-lived or ill people in the eyes of outsiders, but here, it is how they identify family.\n\nI took the liberty of modifying the Mikage Furnace, throwing a few valves and panels into the sea and improving the containment dome, which back then could, at best, be rated \"better than nothing.\" I wonder if those engineers from Fontaine will be pleasantly surprised?\nOld man Kujou might get a little upset from production going down, but at least the furnace isn't going to go haywire from overheating, and I believe that even in the event of a war, which may soon come, the explosion should not be too large.\n\"Large\" according to my personal standards, of course.\n\nHmm, actually, might my ingenious interventions perhaps prevent war from breaking out at all?\nWell, I for one would be more than pleased to see the expressions on those astrologers' faces when their predictions come to naught! Hah!\n\nYashiori Island\nAh, the clear blue skies over Yashiori Island really are a pleasant sight.\nThose stodgy onmyouji explained that the Raiden Shogun placed many \"wards\" over this place to prevent the corruption that seeps from the remnants of the serpent god... or something like that. I'm not good with their religious jargon.\nAs far as I can observe, those lamp posts are quite interesting. Although they have the appearance of items dedicated to the Electro Archon, the techniques used to make them are quite familiar to me.\nOh, whoa, would you look at that! This is supposed to be a travelogue, not some tedious academic paper!\n\nWe were warmly welcomed by Washizu, the head of Higi Village. The grilled fish and onigiri were great!\nAlso, that place they call Nazuchi Beach is full of friendly pirates... Ah, it's just a shame that I couldn't stay on this island for longer.\nThe mines on the island are busy places indeed, but the equipment they use there is quite backward. Even though the Shogun put all those wards down, blocking off most of the Tatarigami's spread, many miners have still contracted chronic illnesses from prolonged exposure to the influence of those snake-bone crystals.\n\nThe Sakura Mochi that the onmyouji brought with them are very tasty, but they're hardly the equal of the beauties that Little Yae makes.\n\nI should probably pay a visit to Asase Shrine later. I wonder how that fat cat's been doing lately...

The ink-like flames raged and spread, devouring hundreds of houses all the way to the seaside, causing the seawater to steam and churn, and turning the sand on the shallows into a molten slurry.\nThe chieftain shoved Riko into an underground cellar. The last words she heard still rang in her ears, drowning out the cries of anguish all around.\n\"Kataba Shintetsu has betrayed the oni. It was she who brought about this disaster!\"\nRiko's swordsmanship was taught to her by Shintetsu personally. As far as she could remember, Shintetsu was a demure girl who always wore a faint smile as she talked to others.\nUntil today, Riko still could not accept that her teacher, the sword prodigy respected by all, could have done something so cruel.\nBut yet the symbols and talismans scattered around the village made a convincing counterpoint. The chieftain could not have been mistaken...\nHow should she face Shintetsu?\nRiko had not yet decided, and could only sigh deeply.\nThe noise startled a nearby white cat, and squinting its two mottled eyes, the cat rubbed the back of Riko's hand.\n\"Sorry, Onigiri. Did I wake you?\"\nRiko brought her wooden bowl out and placed it before the cat. Listening to the soft sounds of it lapping at the water, she looked up at the sky outside her tent.\nThrough the gaps in the leaves could the cliffs and mountains under the moonlight be seen, its silver glow tracing the intricate outlines of buildings on the ridges, forming a unique spectacle.\nArayama City lay before her. The towering mountains had all been hollowed out, with a majestic city being built within them. Legend had it that the \"people of the mountain\" here were the descendants of giants, standing at two times the height of an ordinary person. Even the plants and crops here were larger than anything elsewhere. Moreover, Arayama City's \"Arahara Army\" was said to be powerful indeed, having fought with the surrounding nations many times while suffering very few defeats.\nBut Arayama City's brutal lord was not satisfied, and would not be till he had achieved absolute dominion.\nThree days ago, the lord had invited Kataba Shintetsu to join the Arahara Army and train his troops in the swordsmanship that the oni had prided themselves in. Shintetsu had agreed gladly...\nBut regardless of Shintetsu's intentions, Riko's current goal was to find her, defeat her, and mete out the punishment she deserved.\nThen, she would follow the clues that the chieftain had given her to search for the true teachings of \"Shiseidou,\" and use the magatama within Onigiri's body to revive her tribespeople.\nThinking thus, Riko put a little more wood on the fire before lying down her side and entering a shallow slumber, preserving her strength for the battle that would commence the next day.\n...\nArayama City Arc: Chapter 15\nThe standoff had been broken.\nThe burly commander stood about a hundred paces off, observing the battle personally and executing several deserters. These deeds had the remarkable effect of calming the Arahara Army and steadying their formation. No one dared speak of the assassination of their lord now.\n\"What are you afraid of? That little brat doesn't even come up to a Lavender Melon's height. Get her!\"\nThe troops looked at each other until forced by their commander's enraged roar to charge at Riko.\nRiko heard it, of course. The hand that wielded her sword trembled, and Onigiri, hidden within her hood, mewled softly in fear.\nWell, I'm sorry that we oni lived on a deserted island and didn't get an opportunity to grow tall, and thus aren't fit to be your opponents.\nBut a \"fit\" has got nothing to do with my ability to defeat you.\nSpinning on one tipped toe, Riko let fly her blade with a transient flash of crimson red. Light arced across the battlefield, piercing through the commander's torso.\n\"Kissaki Yousen.\"\nThis was the same special sword technique that the wandering spirit of the previous lord of the city had imparted to Riko — a fatal blade that utterly ignored all distances in battle.\nWith a terrible, clean crack, the enemy commander's sword split in two, and he fell forward with an inaudible murmur, dead.\nSeeing their general go down, the Arahara Army stopped dead in its tracks. Not a single soldier dared to go a step further. Indeed, their formation fell into chaos swiftly thereafter, melting away utterly.\nThus did Arayama City fall, and thus did the people who had long been oppressed rise up and take the lord's mansion, seizing back all that had once belonged to them.\nYet through all this, Kataba Shintetsu did not show her face.\nSheathing her sword, Riko realized that something was off, glancing upward towards the distant mountain peak.\nThere stood Shintetsu upon Arayama City's greatest height, atop its blazing tower, watching the whole battle. Her face was shrouded in shadow, her expression unreadable.\nThe two women locked gazes for an instant, and then with a leap, Shintetsu was gone.\nKataba Shintetsu... Why had she come here? She had accepted the invitation of the lord of this city, only to turn around and assassinate him...\nDid she still have some good left in her?\nRiko shook her head. Now was not the time for excess thoughts. Comforting Onigiri, she quickly ran towards Arayama City.\nIf she did not continue her pursuit in all haste, Shintetsu was sure to leave her far behind.\n...\nRyuutetsu Cage Arc: Chapter 1\nShe had gotten careless. This encampment was nothing but a well-disguised trap.\nKataba Shintetsu had intentionally exposed her tracks, placing a large number of talismans amidst the camp, luring Yutaka Riko to pursue her. The moment Riko stepped into the camp, the talismans blew the mountainside clean away, and losing her footing, Riko plummeted into the chasm below...\nThe impact of the fall was not an issue, but Ryuutetsu Cage, which lay below in the depths of the mountain, was the greatest threat.\nThis chasm was once a pass separating two nations, and it was the site of a monstrous battle in which nearly a million people were slain. After the war ended, the two nations both sealed this area, pouring their destroyed weapons into this mountain rift. The souls of the unjustly slain warriors were trapped within the bloodied, broken metal, and as the shattered metal churned and turned, it would slowly evolve into the flowing metal sands seen today.\nThere was no clear distinction between solid ground and the metal dunes, and one could step out onto the sand and immediately sink into the mire, unable to escape as the churning metal sands had swallowed and ground one into dust. One wrong step, and there would be no going back. This strange iron sand even spread across the stone walls, making even the idea of escape by climbing out laughable in the extreme.\nOnly by slowly traversing the path at the bottom of the chasm could one have any hope of escape. But it was clear that no one had ever managed it. Those who fell into this cage may as well have been sentenced to death.\nBut Riko was like a woman unburdened. Here was undeniable proof that Kataba Shintetsu had long forsaken any mercy or goodness. Now, when she lifted her sword against her, Riko would not have to hesitate.\nNot only this, but Shintetsu had underestimated the progress that Riko had made. This prison of metal sand would not hold her, for she had previously mastered the powerful ability named \"Reppuu Tenshoku,\" which now came in handy.\nBut just as Riko was about to use that technique, she spied two small heads peeping around the corner of a rock face.\nThey were girls dressed in rags, their eyes gleaming with hope.\n\"Are you from the outside world?\"\nRiko nodded, retrieving Onigiri from her hood. It gave the two girls a limp greeting. The two girls took Riko to a mountain cave, and there she met their elders — a miserable group they were, having wound up in Ryuutetsu Cage by mistake.\n\"We've been stuck here for several months now. We've barely managed to get by on the grains on our cart, spring water, moss and wild vegetables...\"\nThey were nine people and one cat. She had just enough strength to carry them all out on the woven wings of a gale.\nThus, she made this offer:\n\"How would you like to escape together with me?\"\nThe old man who led the party kept his eyes on Riko's pale red horn, hesitation in his eyes.\n\"Warrior... If my eyes do not deceive me, you must be of oni descent, right?\"\nUnease flashed across Riko's heart.\n\"That's right, I am an oni. Is there a problem?\"\n...\nRyuutetsu Cage Arc: Chapter 14\nOnigiri's tail, like a compass' needle, quivered for a moment before pointing forward and to the right. Yutaka Riko stepped forward tentatively — onto solid rock.\nGood!\nThe chasm's exit was close at hand now. If she followed her present speed, she and Onigiri would escape Ryuutetsu Cage before dawn the next day.\n\"Well done, Onigiri.\"\nRiko had never known till this day that Onigiri's spirit-sight could not only find wandering spirits that could help Riko master all manner of abilities but that it could also be used to steer clear of danger. The vengeful spirits of the Ryuutetsu Cage were unveiled in Onigiri's eyes as if in plain sight, allowing it to find a safe way through.\nPerhaps this was the work of the magatama within Onigiri... Were her tribespeople watching over her?\nEven so close to freedom and escape, Riko could not be pleased.\nThe words of those people buzzed in her ears, agitating and irritating her.\n\"Even if we starve here, I'll never trust an oni!\"\nWhat was with that? She was an oni, sure, but so what?\nEveryone was kind, and they had lived peacefully and kept to themselves on their island. Why were they seen as the enemy?\nYet the gazes of those two children were too innocent, and Riko would not leave them to their fate. So she had left all her dry rations with them before using \"Kagamichuu Shubutsu\" to copy them several times, thus ensuring that they would have enough food to last another half a month.\nShe had memorized the entire route that she had taken as well. Once they departed, she would look for a nearby garrison and mark the safe route out for them. This way, the garrison would be able to rescue the trapped people.\nAh, this was so exhausting — worse than any battle she had experienced before.\nRiko's eyes were dull as she petted Onigiri idly.\nSometimes, all we need is a scapegoat to pin our negativity on in order to bounce back.\nAs a hazy figure materialized before Riko's eyes, she muttered, irrepressible resentment in her voice,\n\"This is all your fault, Kataba Shintetsu...\"\n\"Next time, I won't let you escape.\"\n..."},{"id":"Book304","title":"Book304","filename":"Book304_EN.txt","text":"Yarr harr, you bilge-rats!\nForgotten all about yer old captain after not seein' him fer so long?\nHeartless rats, the lot of ya!\nSorry, but ol' Rinzou, yours truly, has decided to retire!\nWell then, you rats.

As such, her early years were filled with stories and tales about Saiguu, and she loved and respected her greatly.\nThis is also why Lady Yae would eventually come to the Grand Narukami Shrine herself after embarking on her own travels.\n\nDue to their closeness by blood, Lady Saiguu doted upon Lady Yae quite a bit, though Lady Yae speaks as little as possible about those times as she may nowadays...\n—And while I as a novelist write to entertain, I shall refrain from revealing too much about Lady Yae's past, lest I suffer under the editor-in-chief's mighty pen.\n\nBut back to Urakusai. It is no longer clear how Urakusai angered Lady Saiguu back in the day, but it is known that his deeds may have had some connection to the later incursion of the Abyss.\nHowever, after Urakusai had been driven out, the Kitsune Saiguu would no longer dwell at the Grand Narukami Shrine, but would instead set up permanent residence at Tenshukaku.\n\n\"A disaster that will engulf heaven and earth is coming. My duty is to defend the people and protect our lord, and so I must go to the Shogun's side.\"\n\nWhen Lady Saiguu departed the second time, Lady Yae was but a young girl. The person she had pursued all this time now left her again. It was not until the untimely disaster swept across the archipelago that we understood the meaning of Lady Saiguu's words...\nBut it was too late, and things had not turned out as we would have wished.\nThis time, Lady Saiguu left a third time. This time, she departed forever.\n\nFive centuries may seem long to mortals, but the joys and sorrows left by the things that happened during that time, whether to fleeting existences or enduring ones, are not easy to erase."},{"id":"Book308","title":"Book308","filename":"Book308_EN.txt","text":"The version of this tale most widely accepted by the people of both Narukami and Watatsumi Island reads as follows:\nAround two thousand years ago, the Archon War was drawing to a close in Inazuma.\nIt is said that during this time, the Great Serpent Orobashi broke the coral branches off his body and guided the people of the deep sea back to the light of day, and by his grace and pity, he gathered them together to make a living upon the barren island of coral.\nBut in this world of fickle fortune, humans, puny as they are, often suffered on account of their bitter lives and were gloomy because of their pain and misfortune. The bright sun, the clear skies, and seas, the clam palace that glittered with rainbow light, the teachings of the clergy... None of these could assuage the wounds of hunger and disease.\nThe Great Serpent never forgot his past as one of the defeated, or his oath to never again allow his people to be forsaken. So he asked the shrine maiden:\n\"Blessed daughter of mine, why do the people of the deep sea weep? Have I not defeated the Dragonheirs of the Depths and given you the light of day?\"\nThe wise shrine maiden replied:\n\"Famine.\"\nThe Great Serpent asked again:\n\"Indeed, it is my failing that has caused you to go hungry. What then, my people, is your request?\"\nThe honest elders replied:\n\"You made a road for us, guiding us to create a nation amidst the blue seas with no need for robbery, oppression, or tyranny. For this, we are already more than grateful... Yet, to the east of our coral island, there are lands wider and more fertile still.\"\n\"Permit us, great lord, to set foot upon those islands and there carve out a dominion for ourselves, that our children after us shall have a glorious past, a future in fullness, and a present without darkness.\"\n\nThe Great Serpent was silent and made no reply.\nNarukami it was that dominated the eastern islands, possessing great strength in war, and those deities defeated thus were all slain to the last, in accordance with the law of the divine realm.\nBut in the many years that followed, the hungry and diseased people would ask time and again, at last moving the heart of their god.\nThus did the Great Serpent train them to become mighty warriors who commandeered ships and sea monsters while mastering wave and cloud, leading them in an invasion of the Electro Archon's lands amidst the whistling of whalesongs...\nBut the people of the sea knew not that Watatsumi Omikami had embarked upon a violent campaign in which he had no hope of victory, and his purpose was not conquest, but sacrifice.\nIt is said that there were inscriptions which the shrine maiden hid, upon which were written a prophecy of the certain defeat and the future of humiliation that awaited this eastern expedition.\n\nOrobashi's true motives are not well-recorded by history. This is merely a hypothesis drawn by those who discovered the inscriptions in latter days:\nWatatsumi Omikami long knew that he would not have any chance of survival this time, but accepted the prophecy's result calmly.\nIf he wished to ensure the perpetuation of his people's \"faith,\" there was but one path — sacrifice. Even if Watatsumi would pass away, its people would endlessly weave their memories of joy, prosperity, bitterness, and loss into a united faith. These memories, in turn, would flourish on account of the intense emotions of a vanquished people forced into shameful submission.\n\nMany among the Watatsumi people now no longer believe that their guiding Omikami has any chance of revival, but their pride as Watatsumi's people, the pain of watching the body of their god carved up for minerals by their overlord, the hurt of losing that god... These emotions have passed on from generation to generation, becoming the pillars of forbearance, resistance, and sacrifice that underpin the faith of Watatsumi's people.\n\nAs the author has mentioned, Sangonomiya has an extreme lack of written historical material. As such, these past motives have all essentially become fictional tales upon which future generations can inscribe any meaning they wish. Thus, these histories have become \"histories of accumulated consciousness\" rather than \"histories of recorded fact.\" The fact that this collective consciousness has been strengthened and rendered ever more cohesive over time, such that a people who have lost their beloved god may still actively resist a nation whose faith is in a mighty elemental deity... This just goes to show that their persistence is hardly some obsolete thing.\n\nNotably, this tendency to give little thought to the \"facts\" of the past and emphasize the \"consciousness\" of the present is a glaring flaw in Watatsumi today. The flames of these hatreds and humiliations, borne and nursed over hundreds and thousands of years, can be fanned by those with an agenda in leaner years and ultimately bring catastrophe upon the nation.\n\nBut though I say this, while the people of Watatsumi are known for their forbearance, are they really to grin and bear this mortification endlessly for the sake of survival?\nWith their recent economic exploitation at the hands of the Kanjou Commission, more and more of the young people of Watatsumi Island are discussing resistance and their complaints. It seems evident to me that these discussions are not merely about the past, but about the present and future also.\n\nHowever, there is another version of the legend of Watatsumi Omikami's slaying:\nWhile the people of the deep yet dwelt in the depths, they kept very reliable chronicles, for there was no day or night for them. If they kept no precise records, they would even forget what time it was. But these chronicles were ordered sealed in Enkanomiya by the Great Serpent, never to be retrieved.\nThe names of the people of Watatsumi were also not written in the Inazuman style then. The names and surnames used today by them came about by order of the Great Serpent, who had them learn the traditions of Narukami.\nIt is said that when Watatsumi Omikami decided to bring the people of the depths out of the waters, he did this at the instruction of the heavens themselves. For Watatsumi Omikami had once fled into the Dark Sea to avoid the Archon War, committing a grave sin in the process. Thus perhaps it was upon heaven's order that Orobashi went to his death — though this cannot be known for sure.\nUnfortunately, the script once used in Enkanomiya is known to few, and the books themselves have been hidden there also. Thus, I fear that the truth of the matter shall never see the light of day.\nHowever, these legends that hint at the \"truth\" are but unimportant anecdotes compared to the aforementioned ones that imply much about the \"consciousness\" of the people."},{"id":"Book309","title":"Book309","filename":"Book309_EN.txt","text":"The shrine maiden Mouun was born to the Yuna Clan. This clan was one of the great houses that first followed their Omikami out into the sunlight, and is still known today for their traditional talent in whalesongs and their closeness with all marine life. Mouun entered Sangonomiya Shrine at a young age and would learn the etiquette and ritual arts of the Watatsumi shrine maidens, history, governance, and the island folk-tunes. Her younger twin sister Ayame, who in later days would be known as \"Umigozen,\" was a female diver, making a living through collecting pearls.\nBy the time news that the Shogunate had unified all the Inazuman islands reached Watatsumi, Mouun and Ayame were already quite famous among the island's people. In the folk-tunes that still persist till today, Mouun was a wise and gentle soul who helped to steer the people away from meaningless conflict, while Ayame was valiant and cheerful, her power sufficient to wrestle against fierce sea creatures.\n\nWhen Watatsumi Omikami ceased in his hesitation and embarked on that hopeless eastern expedition, Sangonomiya's first navy was entrusted by the then-Divine Priestess to Mouun and her sister. This was also the beginning of Mouun's association with the giant whale named \"Daikengyou.\"\n\nLegend has it that Daikengyou was a huge blind whale that had lived for five hundred years and four hundred years before that. The dark depths of the ocean floor were its home, and the fishes of the deep and the moonglow-beauteous jellyfish were its faithful servants. Five hundred narwhals guarded its left flank and five hundred humpback whales played music to its right. Some folk-tunes claim that it could have swallowed ten coral islands in one gulp before spitting out five skerries in its deep, satiated slumber.\n\nEven amongst those of the Watatsumi people who were skilled in whalesong, none had faced this titan and returned whole to tell the tale. But at the Divine Priestess' direction, Mouun dived deep into the whale's phosphorescent palace just as the moon rose high enough to pierce the ocean mists. None knew how Mouun persuaded Daikengyou to join her. But on the third moonrise after her departure, when the waves drew back from the shore, the people witnessed Daikengyou surface from the tranquil ocean, shimmering with silver light as it bore Mouun on its back.\n\nLater, Daikengyou and its marine courtiers would follow Mouun and her sister into battle at Omikami's side, though the battle ultimately and inexorably went ill...\nMouun made to retreat when she heard that Omikami and Touzannou had been slain together, but she was ambushed by the tengu Sasayuri's subordinates en route and was herself slain together with Daikengyou the mighty whale, their remains captured by the Shogunate. As for her sister, \"Umigozen\" Ayame, she disappeared into the blood-red ocean after a valiant stand, never to be seen again."},{"id":"Book30","title":"Book30","filename":"Book30_EN.txt","text":"The monarch of this kingdom was a beautiful princess with skin as white as snow. Just like the moon, she had the brightest skin, the purest eyes, and the kindest soul. People of the kingdom all vowed their loyalty to her and referred to her as The Pale Princess.\nThe Pale Princess ruled her kingdom with kindness and gentleness. She always knew what was best for her people. Under her rule, the people of the Moonlight Forest never knew the threat of the Night Mother's wrath, and the creatures lurking in the dark never dared to set foot in the forest.\nHowever, the Princess had her own troubles. To her, the silvery moon hanging in the night sky seemed like a tiny hole through which the light could pass, and she felt that by following the light back to its source one could almost see the world on the other side. Just like all other people, the Pale Princess would often sit on the stone plate in front of the palace, imagining a world beyond the moonlight.\n\"Will I be able to bring my people there one day?\" The Princess thought to herself. \n\"You will.\"\nShe had not expected to hear an answer.\nThe Princess turned and saw a young prince."},{"id":"Book310","title":"Book310","filename":"Book310_EN.txt","text":"Touzannou's name is not known, but it is known that he was of low birth, such that some island folk-tunes name him \"the legacy of moonlight and tide,\" or \"the forgotten child of the moonlight.\" Perhaps he was an orphan, or perhaps he was the child of people who had been washed ashore by the sea.\n\nBut though he had neither name nor surname, nor a clan to protect him as he grew, Watatsumi Omikami accepted this child nonetheless, just as he had once accepted the lost people trapped in the depths.\nThis boy later apprenticed himself to Mouun and her sister, learning from them the whalesongs and rites of Watatsumi. His memories were colored by the palace of coral and clam, the shining schools of fish and the rainbow-hued mackerel, and his body was tempered by the rugged reefs and endless waves, becoming strong and swift.\n\nThe songs of the Yuna Clan say that when the boy had grown into a young man, he was invited by Mouun the shrine maiden to swim together amidst tides lit by moon and stars alike. In the ebb and flow of the entwined lights, the young man sensed the words and emotions of the sea creatures, and hearing the shrine maiden's gentle, mournful whispers, he decided his future course.\n\nIt is said that after this night-time excursion, the young man comprehended the sword styles known as \"Getsumouun\" and \"Yuushio.\" Though he would not have any descendants, these sword techniques would be taught amongst the warriors of Watatsumi and passed down from generation to generation, thus never becoming extinct. In Watatsumi Island, which lacks traditions of swordsmanship, these two styles remain effective and practical techniques that can prove perilous to any foe.\n\nWhen Watatsumi Omikami set off on the eastern expedition from which there would be no return, the young man headed up the vanguard and took a place known then to the Watatsumi people as Touzan. Thus was he given the honorific of Touzannou by Watatsumi Omikami himself. However, this valiant \"king of the eastern mountain\" would become known as a brutal, savage \"wicked king,\" or Akuou, to the people of Yashiori Island.\n\nUltimately, Akuou and his lord were both judged by the Musou no Hitotachi, and Mouun, who once trod upon the waves with him on that moonlit night, was lost amidst a storm of black feathers, her people bewailing her fate.\nAnd when the dust settled, things had not turned out as they might have hoped.\n\nNotably, people still call outstanding warriors \"the scions of Touzannou,\" although the young and presumptuous Touzannou himself never had the opportunity to join himself to the one he loved, nor would they ever enjoy a peaceful future together."},{"id":"Book311","title":"Book311","filename":"Book311_EN.txt","text":"It is often said that the \"drawn bow is like the quartered moon, and studying the blade is like a circle of transparent jade.\"\n\nIt is said that when Narukami came to her people, she brought with her the knowledge of crafting swords. After thousands of years and hundreds of bountiful harvests, mortal swordsmiths were at last able to make swords that would please even Narukami herself. Thus did the Grand Shrine and the Shogunate enact this divine ceremony: they collected the greatest swords in the world and offered them up to the shrine, thus naming these blades \"Goshintou.\" This ceremony was a very lively one indeed, and the practice persists to the present period. However, there are many behind-the-curtain matters concerning the \"Goushintou\" that few know of.\nNo famous craftsman merely forges one blade in one sitting. The greatest of their works are known as \"Shinuchi,\" and are given a lovely name before being offered to the craftsman's lord or deity. These are not built for taking lives and are to remain pure. The others are known as \"Kageuchi\" and will be given to retainers for them use as weapons. These will often be used to shed blood and will thus be stained with impurity and filth.\n\nFrom the day Narukami Gongen, the First Shogun, began her dominion over the land of Inazuma, she was accompanied by her younger twin sister. \"Shin\" and \"Kage,\" light and dark they were, mediating and holding court, ordering and giving battle. The younger of the two was named \"Ei,\" and if her name were to be written plainly, it would likely be the word for \"shadow,\" which she was in relation to the first Shogun, to whom she would become the successor.\nAs most know, only The Seven emerged from the wrack and ruin of the war that rolled across the mortal world like a crimson storm. Though the Shadow Shogun was divinely skilled in martial arts and unsurpassed with the blade, she believed herself little more than a warrior with little understanding of mortal hearts. Thus, she chose to give up her bodily form, helping her sister to ascend to the \"heavenly citadel\" and obtain dominion over Inazuma. Shortly after, the True Shogun, \"Makoto,\" set up her Shogunate and began to rule over the land. Remembering their bond, she recalled \"Ei\"'s divine will and reforged her body, thus returning her sister to her side once more as her kagemusha."},{"id":"Book312","title":"Book312","filename":"Book312_EN.txt","text":"My exploration of Tsurumi Island has not gone smoothly.\n\nEarlier, it was thanks to a local youth named Kama that I was able to leave Ritou successfully and arrive on Tsurumi Island undetected. At his direction, I tried to penetrate the thick fog that shrouds the island and somehow managed to catch a hurried glimpse of the ancient civilization present here, as well as certain dream-like landscapes. However, these memories seem to have dispersed just like a mist might...\nBut I can still clearly remember meeting a small child on this supposedly long-dead island.\n\nPerhaps he was nothing but a hallucination I saw under the influence of Elemental Particles floating through the fog, or perhaps the mushrooms on the island were to blame...

The Sunchild had long intended to punish Aberaku. Summoning the sage before the throne in this manner was but an additional way of making things difficult for him before detaining him.\nLegend has it that Aberaku was opened up to wisdom by Tokoyo Ookami, and was thus able to bring light to Enkanomiya, which had till then never seen the sun.

O heavenly gods, these creations are your works. Grant us divine wisdom — let us endlessly record!\n\n\"When the Doves Held Branches\"\nWhen the eternal throne of the heavens came, the world was made anew. Then the true lord, the Primordial One, came forth and did battle against the seven terrifying sovereigns, dragon-lords of the old world.\nThe Primordial One created shining shades of itself, and the number of these shades was four.\n\n\"On Phanes, or The Primordial One\"\nThe Primordial One may have been Phanes. It had wings and a crown, and was birthed from an egg, androgynous in nature. But for the world to be created, the egg's shell had to be broken. However, Phanes, the Primordial One, used the eggshell to separate the \"universe\" and the \"microcosm of the world.\"\n\n\"Forty Years After the Held Branches\"\nForty winters entombed the flames, and forty summers churned the seas. The Seven Sovereigns were vanquished, and the seven nations submitted to the heavens. The Primordial One, the great sovereign, began the creation of heaven and earth for \"our\" sake — that of its creations which it cherished most, who would soon appear upon this earth.\n\n...\n\n\"Four Hundred Years After the Held Branches\"\nThe mountains and rivers were made, and the seas and oceans accepted those who rebelled and those who would not kneel. The Primordial One and one of its shades created the birds of the air, the beasts of the earth, and the fish of the sea. Together, they also created flowers, grass, and trees, before finally creating humans — our ancestors, numerous as the stars in the sky, uncountable as the sand on the shore.\nFrom that time, our ancestors made a covenant with the Primordial One, and so entered into a new age.\n\n\"The Year of the Ark's Opening\"\nThe Primordial One had a sacred plan for humans. As long as they were happy, it too rejoiced.\n\n\"The Year After the Ark's Opening\"\nThe people worked the land, and so came the first harvest. The people mined, and so reaped the first crop of precious ore. The people gathered, and the first poems were written.\n\n\"The Year of Jubilee\"\nIf there was hunger, the heavens would bring down food and rain. If there was poverty, the earth would bring forth its riches. If melancholy were to spread, the heavens would reply with their voices.\nThe one taboo was to succumb to temptation. But the path to temptation had already been sealed.\n\n...\n\n\"The Funerary Year\"\nThe second throne of the heavens came, and war was rekindled, as it was in the world's creation. That day, the heavens collapsed and the earth was rent asunder. Our ancestors and their ancestral land fell into this place during that conflict.\nThe era of darkness had begun.\n\n\"The First Year of Darkness\"\nThe people of the Seven Sovereigns had found refuge in the oceans, and the Dragonheirs of the Depths ruled this particular place, which led to war between them and our ancestors.\nOur ancestors chased them into the shadows with the light of a thousand lanterns, and they hid in those shadows, hunting us. But there was only darkness in this place, and so their hunting grounds were untrammeled.\nThe prayers of the people turned into lamentations, but the Primordial One and its three other shining shades could not hear.\n\n\"The Parable of the Sun\"\nIn a dark cavern, there lived a group of people who had never seen the light. Among them was a sage who had once seen the sun, and he told the gathered folk about what life under the sun was like, and about the great might of the sun. Seeing that they did not comprehend, he lit a torch — and thus did people come to worship the flame, believing it to be the sun. They even got used to a life of darkness and fire.\nWhen the sage died, someone would monopolize the flame. Using it, they would cast a long shadow over the land.\n\n\"The Parable of the Lethied Lotus\"\nA lotus that causes all who look upon it to forget their troubles. A ship captain searching for the way back to the surface discovered a tribe of people who ate these lotuses. Some crew members stayed in that place. Others rejected that temptation.\nLife is a boundless ocean of suffering. We are only searching for the way home.\n\n\"The Third Year of Darkness\"\nWe knew the only one who had not forsaken us as the \"Ruler of Time.\" She was the moment. She was every moment. She was the measure of a thousand winds and the sun and the moon. She was every second of joy, every moment of rage, every instant of longing, every minute of obsession. She was every flash of delirium.\nWe call her Kairos, or \"the ruler of the unchanging world.\" We dare not speak her true, secret name, and so I pen it here, only once, and in reverse: \"Htoratsi.\"\n\n...\n\n\"The Year of Blindness\"\nThe sage Abrax's wisdom was awakened, and he unveiled a light-bringing miracle from within his hands. So our ancestors began to build the Helios, with him as their leader.\n\n...\n\n\"The Year of Sight, or the First Year of Sun and Moon\"\nHelios, the divine chariot of the sun, was finally completed. The Whitenight came, and Evernight was banished.\nThe years of the Sun and Moon had begun.\n\n\"The Second Year of Sun and Moon\"\nOur ancestors sought the returning way, for surely the war on the surface had ended by then.\nBut the Primordial One, the first throne, had laid down a ban, preventing our ancestors from finding the path home.\nIn that case, the Primordial One must have defeated the Second Who Came.\nAbrax was imprisoned by order of the Sunchild.\n\n\"The Parable of the Tree\"\nThe king's gardener and the tree spirit of the royal garden were in love. But the king wished to repair the beams of his pavilion, and so needed to cut down the tree with the most spiritual energy within it. The king was the incarnation of the Primordial One, and the gardener could not defy the sovereign of sovereigns, and so he could only bring his plea to the king's priest, who was the incarnation of Tokoyo Ookami.\nThe priest had pity on the gardener and said to him: \"Go, and cut the branches of the spirit-tree down.\" The gardener did so, and afterward did as the king ordered, cutting the spirit-tree itself down.\nThen the priest said: \"Plant the spirit-tree's branches in the ground.\" But the gardener said: \"A spirit-tree shall take five hundred years to grow.\" The priest said: \"Your one thought shall echo through eternity.\" And so the gardener planted the branches in his back yard. In an instant, the slim branches grow into a new tree, and the new tree spirit was a continuation of the past one.\nFor it is the God of Moments who is able to take \"seeds\" from this \"moment\" into the past and the future.\n\nThe Tenth Year of Sun and Moon\nAbrax is long gone. The events before the sun and the moon have been recorded sufficiently. Well, if I did not dare to write things down just as they happened, how could I consider myself a scribe of Tokoyo Ookami?\nHark, I hear armor without.

All we formerly knew of land and sea was given unto us directly by the heavens. In this new world of ours, we must begin groping even for the simplest methodologies anew.\nO you who come after and read these words, do not take the life you lead for normalcy. Even if after a hundred or a thousand years, people should grow used to life down here, always remember — these days with neither sun nor moon are abnormal. Even if some sage were to draw us the sun, there will surely be filthy wretches who will borrow its light to cast long shadows over us.\nThis book is intended to help people understand the world they live in, and to never forget our desire to return to the light.\n(This book has been constantly edited, redacted, and modified over the years. Even the name of the book's title has seen change from \"Aphotic Earth\" to \"Tokoyokoku,\" before becoming \"Byakuyakoku.\" Later, due to the grace of Watatsumi, the people of the depths would return to the sea's surface. But it seems like \"Aphotic Earth\" has some special meaning, and it has not been universally changed throughout the text.)\n\nOf Wind and Water\nByakuyakoku has no mountains to speak of, and so it is pointless to speak of them. However, our priests and sages have detected something. Even in these depths, the power of the \"undying wind\" and the \"water\" still remain. The personification of the \"undying wind\" is known as \"Tokoyo Ookami,\" and is poetically rendered \"the thousand winds\" or \"the thousand winds of time.\" \"Water,\" on the other hand, is the might of the Vishap Realm, represented by the Bathysmal Vishaps.\nWe have already developed a certain field of study regarding the relationship between Sunfire, wind, and water. As such, both hydrology and the undying wind must be considered before undertaking any project of civil engineering.\n\nThe Borders of Byakuyakoku\nThe borders of Byakuyakoku are marked out by three corners. These mark the limits of the see-saw clash between humanity and the vishaps.\nDuring the era of Byakuyakoku, Towers of the Three Realms were built at these three corners, used to harmonize the three realms. Their ancient names have been lost to time, and they were renamed after the coming of Watatsumi.\nThese towers are exceedingly important, and they are not in locations aligned with either wind or water. Rather, their purpose is to stabilize the tendencies of Byakuyakoku and control its winds and waters.\nIf these towers were to be imperiled, so would the entire nation. As such, they have been hidden using secret arts. Only the shrine maidens and the Vassals of Watatsumi can summon them forth.\n\nThe Narrows\nThe Narrows were, in the earliest times, sandwiched between the mountain face and an area known as the Roundlands, thus earning that location its name. However, the exceedingly strange tectonic shifts in Byakuyakoku caused the Roundlands to collapse into the depths, thus causing The Narrows to widen significantly.\n\nThe Serpent's Heart\nFrom the first time our ancestors discovered this place, it had already played host to a unique phenomenon in which space itself might overlap in a certain locale. Later, those who came before us would utilize this phenomenon by creating the Serpent's Heart. It would be used to guard secrets, imprison criminals, and worship the great imaginary serpent, Ouroboros.\nIn the earliest times, this place was called Delphi, the land of snakes. This name did not change even after the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami. Ancient art depicts the scaleless serpent as \"Ouroboros,\" and the coral-adorned serpent as \"Orobashi.\"\n\nDainichi Mikoshi\nThe earliest name of this place was \"Helios,\" and it was the high tower built by the sage Aberaku, standing for earth, the element between wind and water.\nAccording to prophecy, this was likely the sun that the sage displayed, used to light those lightless caverns. And just as those prophecies suggested, it was also later used to cast a great shadow over the nation."},{"id":"Book335","title":"Book335","filename":"Book335_EN.txt","text":"...Effective today, all experiments regarding the Dragonheirs will be directed by Watatsumi Omikami in person. All files preceding the founding year of the Watatsumi calendar have been destroyed. Dossier serial numbers shall no longer use the categories Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon, which used the ancient Watatsumi tongue. Instead, we shall use Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Ether, and Void going forward.\nAll quotes and notations are to be written within quotation marks (\"\"). The following order of writing should be observed: File Header-Serial Number-Subject-Author. Author can be omitted, or their internal title within the research lab may be used. Usage of a researcher's ancient Byakuyakoku/Enkanomiya name or modern Watatsumi/Narukami/Inazuman name is forbidden.\nThese experimental records are not to be used for the writing of diaries, love letters, or fantasy novels.\n\n...\nThe Dragonheirs' (hereafter named Bathysmal Vishaps or simply vishaps) evolution is plain for all to see. (\"Water-101-Dragonheir Evolution: I\")\nWe have tried lowering the temperature in the living environs of a young heat-resistant vishap. As a result, they were weaker once matured. We suspect that this is because its body did not possess the \"seed\" required to resist such an environment. However, its descendants would all possess high body fat, greater predilection towards sleep, and would express the Cryo element. (Please refer to the experimental data after the main text. The abnormal data derived from Sample 3 is due to my assistant feeling sorry for the subject of the anti-hunger control group and feeding it surreptitiously.)\nWhen we then placed their descendants into sweltering conditions, they would again choose, like their ancestors, the heat resistance trait. However, none of them have developed traits indicative of the Pyro element thus far.\nWe do not have enough data to reach a conclusion at present, but we can make an educated guess that Bathysmal Vishaps have the ability to awaken their \"seed\" freely before maturation. Vishap mothers can also create new \"seeds\" to pass on to their descendants should they encounter heretofore unseen, challenging environments.\nIt can be said that even before encountering us, the people of Enkanomiya, the Bathysmal Vishaps had already stored a veritable armory within their bodies.\n...\n\nThe results of the intelligence tests are astonishing. (\"Void-207-Vishap Intelligence Research\"). Through a screening process consisting of rewards and punishments (although previous research indicates that screening is unnecessary — vishaps are, one and all, adapters par excellence), the linguistic capacities of vishaps four generations down are starting to approach that of a 12-year-old human student. Perhaps it might be more accurate to say that vishaps always had their own methods of communication, and what they are displaying here is their ability to learn.\nWe believe that these experiments should be stopped. If not, we may yet be proven narrow-minded for having dismissed that last person who wrote a fantastical tale about vishap-people.\nProphecy holds that the Dragon Sovereign of Water will be born in a human form. We must not let this thing happen in Enkanomiya.\n...\nAll previous attempts at grafting have failed. (\"Void-907-Watatsumi Omikami's Special Orders: I\"). Because they cannot accept Watatsumi Omikami's blood, the vishaps will fall victim to various adverse effects. Perhaps they are not yet strong enough, but we cannot be sure — indeed, according to our rationalized vishap evolutionary roadmap, we should have already bred the strongest vishap possible.\n...\n\nThe grafting can be considered a success. (\"Void-907-Watatsumi Omikami's Special Orders: III\"). The rejection originates from the vishaps having been beings of the Light Realm (also known as elemental creatures), and thus being at odds with the Human Realm, of which Omikami and its coral vassals are a part.\n\nAll experimental logs are closed. No experiment conducted here resulted in the death of any Dragonheirs — they all lived to see the end of their days.\nPraise be to Watatsumi Omikami, gracious and beneficent."},{"id":"Book336","title":"Book336","filename":"Book336_EN.txt","text":"Question 1: What walks on four feet in the early morning, two feet during the day, and three feet at night?\nAnswer: A vishap who transforms into a person to attend a ball, then breaks one of its legs and eventually ends up walking with a cane.\nSages like this answer the most, and it is the children get it right almost exclusively. For adults, it always smells like a horrible conspiracy when a vishap turns into a human. According to a prophecy of old, the Dragon of Water, the ancient lord of vishaps, will definitely descend in the form of a human. However, for children, the answer to the question indicates the possibility of mutual understanding.\nBut it is not a good idea to make vishaps sound adorable. Though such jokes defang the fear, they also lower the guard of the children.\n(Dragonheirs of the Depths have evolved to wield the power of other elements and have hence lost their purity. As such, the Dragon of Water will no longer be born from among their ranks.)\n\nQuestion 2: With only one mouth, this being sometimes has four feet, sometimes, two feet, and sometimes, three feet. Though unable to morph into other things, it is able to walk on the earth, swim in the water, and fly in the sky. The more feet it walks on, the feebler it grows. What is this being?\nAnswer: A human.\nHumans crawl on hands and feet as babies, walk on two legs as adults, and use a cane as elders. The answer is undoubtedly \"a human.\"\n\nQuestion 3: What talks with only one mouth but walks on four and two feet?\nAnswer: Someone raising livestock.\nThis riddle is a very ancient one. In the past, we could only understand the meaning of livestock from reading texts. \"Four legs\" refers to four-legged animals like the Aux, Hors, and Foreste Bore. After Byakuyakoku fell into the ocean depths, these animals died out within two generations due to a lack of habitable land and food.\nSince the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami, some of us have returned to the sea's surface to build a home and interact with the people there. Therefore, we have been able to review the names of these animals. According to the Vassal and the Omikami's prophecy, we shall all move back to the sea's surface someday, so it is important to get these names right.\nAux means cattle, Hors means horse, and Foreste Bore means forest boar.\n\nQuestion 4: Who are the two sisters who give birth to each other every day?\nAnswer: Day and night, or Whitenight and Evernight.\nThis riddle is easy to understand. It alludes to the succession of day and night, which in Byakuyakoku means the cyclical Whitenight and Evernight under the control of the Dainichi Mikoshi. Though the land was in everlasting night before the Dainichi Mikoshi was built, the light of day that people had seen has remained unchanged.\nBy the way, the two special astronomical phenomena of Byakuyakoku — the mirages and the Sinshades — were at first indiscriminately referred to as Eidolons and seen as the two sides of the same coin. It was not until the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami that the people of Byakuyakoku were able to understand the two phenomena and name them differently. Though the sun did not shine upon Byakuyakoku, the mirages that appeared in Whitenights were named Sunfire Phantasms and those of Evernight, Ghostfire Phantasms. As time went by, both of them came to be referred to as Sunfire Phantasms, for they are essentially the same thing.\n\nQuestion 5: I am the Shadowborn of the Lord of Light. I am a wingless bird that rises from the earth to the sky. Those who shed tears in my presence feel no sorrow in their bosoms. Away with a gentle breeze I fade, and thus ends my fleeting life.\nAnswer: The answer is smoke. Birds are winged creatures, and it is normal that they are not seen in Enkanomiya.\n\nQuestion 6: A father has twelve children, each then giving birth to sixty daughters of different appearances. Of them, thirty are pale and thirty are dark. The whole family, knowing not death, will only fade away. Who is the father?\nAnswer: The answer is the year. The people of Byakuyakoku may find the part about sixty pale or dark granddaughters a bit confusing. But everything will start to make sense once they crack Question 4.\nThere used to be a sequel to this riddle in ancient times. It roughly said that every granddaughter would give birth to twelve descendants, and each of them would then have sixty children. Every such child later would give birth to another sixty, who would go on to have children of their own. This would continue until at last, all the offspring would together give birth to the one and only primordial child — Tokoyo Ookami, the \"mother\" of fourteen billion years.\nWatatsumi Omikami forbade people from spreading this riddle.\n\n...\n\nAppendix: Historical Figures, Their Traditional Names, and Narukami-Style Renderings\n\nKairos - Tokoyo Ookami\n...Eris - Arisu\nAbrax - Aberaku\nCharon - Ka...\nSpartacus - Supada\nEmma - Ema\n... - Koi\nAntigone, Antigonus - Antei\n...\n...\nErebos - Eboshi\nEchion - Eki\nUdaeus - Uda\nAsclepius - Surepio\n..."},{"id":"Book337","title":"Book337","filename":"Book337_EN.txt","text":"—Modest Fortune—\nA gust of wind suddenly whistles through the clear skies.

The six pygmies' scheme started to unfold.\nIn her sleep, the Princess had no idea how the Prince was being tortured. In her dream, her lover's body glowed with luminous colors and light scattered gently like satin. The sweet sunlight finally broke through the dark clouds and sprinkled on the living. The orange glow of the setting sun painted a layer of caramel on the blue lake, making the water as sweet as nectar. New colors were painted on the black hills and the ruined city was turned into a candy castle. However, when the Princess called the Prince by name, all she heard in reply were indistinguishable words.\nThe poor Princess had no idea that the Prince could no longer respond to her calling.\nLightning flashed and thunder echoed in the silent night sky. The six pygmies carried out their scheme successfully. To celebrate, they set up a huge pot and cooked a pot of thick soup with moss and poisonous mushrooms. But just as the culprits were enjoying their feast, the Prince's broken soul used up all its remaining power to curse the pygmies. For the rest of their lives, they were tormented by a curse that made them feel as if they were being cooked in a huge cooking pot, unable to ever see the light of day again.\nHowever, during the celebration, one of the pygmies wrapped the Prince in the dirty tablecloth, intent on carrying him back to the dark forest to seek help from the Princess, hoping to wake him up. No one knows if this was out of a lingering sense of loyalty to the Princess, or simply born of his fear of the curse."},{"id":"Book350","title":"Book350","filename":"Book350_EN.txt","text":"(An old notebook.

I trust that among all the unbecoming and foolhardy young adventurers that you've looked after, I'm but one hopeless fool. I hope that I haven't been a big headache for you and that although I've left, I've left you with all good memories. If I ever had any family, you'd be the one dearest to me... There are so many stories that I haven't yet had time to share with you. All I can do is leave some half-finished names on the map. It's a shame that it was done in a haphazard fashion and I didn't get to carry out much background research or fine-tune the wording. I regret not being able to come up with better-sounding names for you and the others.\nAnyway, thank you for taking care of me, but I prefer adventuring alone to being looked after by my seniors.\n\nMr. Khedive, please forgive my willfulness. I understand that you have your concerns. Maybe it's just like you said — the secrets hidden in the depths of The Chasm are beyond mere mortals. Maybe that's the reason why the exploration took a toll on me, as I am not blessed with a Vision...\nBut still, I can't help wondering if those famed adventurers like Leonard, Stanley, and Roald have ever witnessed the same marvel as I — the stone halls of old crawling into the darkness, the dark-purple mud gushing out like lava, the translucent, azure crystals floating in the air, the damaged stone tablets carved with maps of ancient places, and so many other indescribable wonders... Would those great adventurers have backed out for fear of danger, or would they have acted as recklessly as I, persisting in pursuing the inscrutable secrets of the world — even at the price of their common and less-dignified lives?\nMr. Khedive, as a scholar, and also a mere mortal like me, what would your choice be in such a circumstance?\n\nClitopho, please accept my apology for my previous distrust and willfulness. I don't have it in for you — despite your annoyingly sneaky ways, Treasure Hoarder background, impoliteness to Jinwu, lack of hygiene awareness when making drinks, complete disregard to the safety regulations of the Ministry, and reluctance to heed our warnings no matter the scenario...

Thank you for all your efforts in helping me land a job in the Ministry. Without you, I would have been thrown out of The Chasm the moment I entered it. Maybe the official offer from the Ministry will arrive after my departure. Please keep it for me. I will treat you to dinner if I ever come back, and don't you forget it!\n\n{NICKNAME}, thank you for everything on this trip. You gave me good advice and came to my rescue. For that, I'm forever grateful. It's a shame that I don't know how I can repay you. As someone blessed by the gods, you're bestowed with elemental powers that will aid you in your adventures. Although I might never know the answer, I still wonder how you regard us mere mortals?\n\nIn ancient times when heroes and Yakshas fought alongside Rex Lapis, when colossal boulders were halved to form the mountains, when giant rocks were cast from the skies to create seabeds, what was the place of the mere mortals like us — whom the gods had neither noticed nor recognized? What are our mundane loves and hatreds, mundane happiness and tragedies, mundane achievements and accomplishments, mundane bonds and relationships... Are all these just something of no consequence in the eyes of the gods? Are ancient dwellings of the gods and those unfathomable scenes really far beyond the reach of commonplace human courage?\n\nIt may seem disrespectful to ask these questions when Rex Lapis has only just left us...\nBut when compared with the chosen ones who have gained the gods' blessings by chance, what are we mere mortals unnoticed by the gods to make of ourselves? We've also obtained dreams by chance, and we keep pursuing them throughout our busy, bustling lives... We don't want to be forgotten, and for that we strive hard to make even the slightest difference, or hang tough through laborious work every day with the courage of an ordinary human... Are all these acts of no meaning?\nThink of those herb gatherers who dangle from the top of the cliffs, miners who work day in and day out despite the potential threat of earthquakes, and workers who drive every nail into a giant ship multiple floors in height... If their hard work is dismissed as mundane and unworthy of remembrance, I can't help but question the gods' logic to favor some of our wishes and dignities over others.\n\nWith such questions in mind, I follow you into the uncertainty and danger in the depths of The Chasm, pushing my limit as a mere mortal. I wouldn't say that I've \"conquered\" or \"explored\" the area, but I hope that I can at least put The Chasm into the map that I drew and edited. I want to mark the places that I've been to and the varying sceneries in The Chasm with names that belong to mortals, names that belong to me.\nFor lack of a smarter solution, I believe that this is the only way to inspire those who come after me. I want to tell them how far someone who was not chosen by the gods can go and what stories she may leave behind.\n\nPlease worry not for me. My journey has only just begun. Once I'm done taking a breather, I will march deeper in. Thank you for helping me clear the path ahead. I will continue venturing into the depths of The Chasm until my strength fails me.\nGood luck, my fellow teammates.\nI hope that we shall meet again on our journeys in the near future.\n<image name=UI_TheChasmWedgeOfSealMap_2 />"},{"id":"Book354","title":"Book354","filename":"Book354_EN.txt","text":"Two Days Before the Festival\nShip and Guests: large passenger ship, bards from Mondstadt, a guest painter, Calx, and his dependent.\nEstimated Arrival Time: 8 AM\n\nSecond Day of the Festival\nShip and Guests: large passenger ship, calligraphers and painters from Liyue, Theater Mechanicus players, and a guest writer, Zhenyu.\nEstimated Arrival Time: 10 AM\n\nThird Day of the Festival\nShip and Guests: large cargo ship, stopover, one person.\nEstimated Arrival Time: 9 AM\n\n...\n\nThe Day Following the Release Event\nShip and Guests: small passenger ship, two persons.\nEstimated Arrival Time: 10 AM"},{"id":"Book355","title":"Book355","filename":"Book355_EN.txt","text":"About The Five Kasen:\nLong ago, there were five legendary poets in Inazuma. Supremely gifted in music and writing, they were honored as the Five Kasen — meaning five fairies of singing and poetry. It is said that the Shogun loved their works profoundly, and that every year one of them would go to Tenshukaku and present their new poetry collection for the Shogun's perusal.\nThe Five Kasen are known as Suikou, Aoi no Okina, Akahito, Sumizome, and Kuronushi, respectively.\nBut their real names were lost in history. According to a widely accepted theory, tales of The Five Kasen had once been repeatedly adapted and performed on stage, with the five characters each dressed in a distinct color — green, blue, red, white, and black. Over time, theatergoers started referring to them by these colors, hence the names we see today. Still, there exist other theories. For instance, some believe Suikou was named after his dwelling, a thatched cottage called Suikou Hut. Some also say that the 'Aka' in Akahito was derived from the poet's habit of marking his works with a scarlet red seal.\n...\n\nAbout the tales of The Five Kasen:\nEveryone in Inazuma knows the tale of The Five Kasen, and stories featuring them were once all the rage in Inazuma.\nWhat is unfortunate, however, is that despite their popularity and abundance at the time, not much detail survived till today — most were probably lost during the great calamity five hundred years ago.\nAccording to existing literature, during the golden age when many such stories were being created, they usually followed the same set of rules: Four poems in succession, each telling a fragment of the story from a Kasen's point of view, with the four together completing the whole tale. What was curious was that no single chapter seemed to be narrated from Kuronushi's perspective.\n...\n\nFive Kasen Summary\nSuikou: A free, sake-loving soul born into an ordinary family. Some say he got the name \"Suikou\" from Suikou Hut, the thatched cottage he lived in.\n\nAoi no Okina: An old man accomplished in chess. In addition to poems, he has also left behind a few novels. Some say he was actually a Shogunate official who had not made a name until his senior years. Others say he was not a human, but a very old kitsune in human form.\n\nAkahito: A talented swordsman who most likely came from a martial family. Some say his name was derived from his habit of marking his works with a scarlet red seal.\n\nSumizome: She was once a shrine maiden skilled in floral arts and dancing. Later, she became the Shogun's personal attendant. Some say she resigned from her position after she became famous, and devoted herself to artistic creation. Others say she kept serving the Shogun into her old age.\n\nKuronushi: Little is known about him, nor does anyone know who he really is. Maybe this explains the more varied versions of his identity and personality from story to story as compared to the other four Kasen.\n...\n\n"},{"id":"Book356","title":"Book356","filename":"Book356_EN.txt","text":"The Five Kasen's Splendor: Suikou\n\nMy dwelling was far from the wider world, but for my fame my peace was disturbed.\nIn blue-clad I went before Tenshukaku to present our work, but Aoi's work was missing a page.\nI knelt and begged for divine wrath to be stilled, and I told what I knew of how it was lost.\nThe previous night I had been drunk, and then a person's shadow had passed over me.\nSome treacherous scoundrel must have stolen the poem, leading to my great loss of face.\n"},{"id":"Book357","title":"Book357","filename":"Book357_EN.txt","text":"The Five Kasen's Splendor: Aoi no Okina\n\nGlorious court life was my youth, and my old age a moonlit haze.\nI had not wished to behave so treacherously, but my very life was threatened.\nSo I sought out my old work, and hid it in my clothes.\nI do not understand the reason behind all that has happened, only that the mysterious person's motives must be perverse.\nThis poem was dedicated to Akahito, who to my great sorrow was banished.\n"},{"id":"Book358","title":"Book358","filename":"Book358_EN.txt","text":"The Five Kasen's Splendor: Akahito\n\nLong have I been famed, and since my youth I had great ambition.\nI stamped every new verse with a scarlet seal, and thus was I known to all.\nBut last year when we presented our verses, mine was found to be taken from poets past.\nFor the theft and deception, I was banished into the wilderness.\nThe five radiant lights never shall be again — ah, how the tides do shift!\n"},{"id":"Book359","title":"Book359","filename":"Book359_EN.txt","text":"The Five Kasen's Splendor: Sumizome\n\n\nI submerged the verses into clear water, and the truth did emerge.\n"},{"id":"Book35","title":"Book35","filename":"Book35_EN.txt","text":"This pygmy spirited the Prince's body away from his wicked brethren, plunging into the damp bushes.

But he could never quite recall when his misfortunes had begun. He spent his childhood in Springvale, under the protection of the spring fairy. Indeed, all the hunters lived peaceful and carefree lives.\nWhen Gothson was seven summers old, his father took him to Mondstadt to watch the circus at Ludi Harpastum. This was the first time Gothson had entered the city in his life. He was held spellbound by the aromas of sweets and roasted meats, the brilliant lights and colored paper, the clowns who trained wild boars, and the magicians and their tricks.\nIn his dazzling childhood memories, Gothson dimly saw his father walking into the reveling crowds, passing through an archway marked with the words \"Pile 'Em Up Contest,\" and slowly moving further away from him. But his attention was drawn to the shining fairy of the spring.\nPerhaps he came to understand in his later years that the spirit at the festival was no more than an actor paid 20 Mora a day, but in his young mind, that sight was always one full of fantastical imagination.\nGothson was lulled to sleep by the spring fairy's stories, and far abroad did he wander and adventure in his boundless dreams. In an adventurer's dream, he saw rainbow jam pour forth from the mouth of an ancient relief. Gothson was about to step up and partake of it, when his dream was shattered by the sounds of a fracas.\n\"Run!\" His father's panicked, pudgy face, smeared all over with fruit juice and meat sauce, dominated his vision.\nOver his shoulder, Gothson could see a towering stack of roasted meat under a glowing red light, tottering and trembling as it bent his way amid the horrified cries of the crowd.\n\nIn his flight, Gothson's father knocked a fat lady over, and threw his own hip. At once he fell, his full weight collapsing upon his son. Then, the leaning tower of roasted meat collapsed to echoing screams...\nThe Knights of Favonius took three days to finally clear up the roast meat, vegetables, food items, and other odds and ends that had been scattered all around the square — not to mention carry off those who had gotten a little too out of their gourds.

Captain, I'd ask you not to use your training as a martial artist in this manner. A written report isn't going to save you if the fleet commander hears of this.\"\nSo Mahasti said, but in truth, no one had ever dared to touch his superior. Amidst the delicate balance that Allied Fleet Command maintained internally, his middle-aged captain and superior, Bitchuu Kyuubei, also known as Shinkurou, now also known as \"Semimaru\" using some truly lame pronunciation, was the very same person who everyone was trying to court to their side, and the one most likely to break this deadlock.\nThis was a whole decade ago now...\nShinkurou thought to himself quietly.\n\nThat one victorious battle at Asada Village, on reflection, had been nothing but a minor test of Shinkurou's military prowess. But for the parties involved, this could be called the beginning of the disaster.\nAs expected, the Tai-Shogun would not permit such a talented person to wander in the wild.\nNot long after, Shinkurou would be blinded in both eyes and thrown into jail.\nThis state of affairs lasted until five years ago, when the Imagawa Clan was defeated by an allied army formed under the Oome daimyo clan, beheading its leader in the process. From then, the nation and its people would finally experience a period of peace...\nThat was what the new Seii Tai-Shogun told Shinkurou personally in while the latter was in prison.\nShinkurou had never in his life seen the common folk able to work and live and peace, and this strange Tai-Shogun was likely no saint, either. The general amnesty was something that simply had to be done to win the people over.\nAs he reminisced, Shinkurou could not help but sigh: whether in the past or now, people like him would always be at the center of the vortex, whether they liked it or not.\n\n\"As far as this country is concerned, people like me are traitors, and I suppose that is also the case in this vast universe.\"\nThe Shogun looked at the sitting Shinkurou and spoke in an indifferent voice.\n\"The Imperial Tax is no longer something that this tiny planet in a corner of the universe can take up. And someone of your ability should be free to flex it amidst the stars.\"\n\"Your clan and given names were taken by that cretin Imagawa, yes, but abandon that past.

Failure to do so and anything could happen to my parents.\nMy parents, however, think I am a loser who could neither find a serious job nor save up any Mora.\nThat's rather ironic, considering who I am doing this for... How is it my fault?\nIf it is, I blame myself for my incompetence to find a way out after all the struggles and also my lack of courage to end it once and for all.\nForget it.

I asked you to help patrol the territory half a month ago. How's it going then?\"\n\"Oops, I shouldn't ask about work when you've just returned. Well, as usual, are you going to have dinner first or take a bath first? Or do you prefer...\"\n\"What? 'As usual'? You never greeted me this way when I came back in the past.\"\nHearing my response, the figure dressed in red and white gives a content smile and goes on, \"I wanted to cheer you up a bit seeing your tired face. Now, I gotta get back to cooking. I made your favorite Butter Crab today!\"\n\"Yay! Butter Crab, my favorite Butter Crab!\"\n\nI, the Raiden Shogun, whose signature line is \"Yay!\" and whose favorite food is Butter Crab, spend most of my time with... Um, basically, there are only two kinds of people in my life: nobodies, and the one with fluffy ears and a teasing voice.\nYae Masako, Guuji of the Grand Kaminaru Shrine, descendant of Kitsune lineage, and Eternity's servant and friend... She goes by too many names to remember. In the eyes of the people of Inazuma, she is almost as unapproachable and unfathomable as I.\n\nYet that very Yae Masako is intently watching the Butter Crab as it is being baked.\nYes, simply put, I, the Raiden Shogun, am being looked after by Guuji Yae Masako.\n\nBefore I knew it, I had already got used to this way of life.\nEvery time I just randomly swing my sword, she'll enthusiastically clap her hands and say: \"Good girl!\" Every time I look for some snacks to go with \"Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power,\" she can always produce delicious milk tea and cake in no time. She carefully extinguishes every flicker of potential annoyance as if she is maintaining Eternity. For me, she is like a kitsune from the legend who grants every wish of mine.\n\"Butter Crab is ready! Before enjoying the food, allow me to get back to our previous question about patrolling...\"\n\nMasako turns around, setting the steaming-hot Butter Crab on the table, its scent soon permeating the room. But I can't bring myself to answer her question — to be honest, this is the reason why I am so down today.\nLike I said, there are only Masako and other people in my world.\nAll of them, except Masako, would do the same thing upon seeing me: They would bow to the ground in the most respectful manner and address me as \"Almighty Shogun.\" When I walk away, they will then straighten up with a sigh of relief.\nIt doesn't matter if they are someone's wife, father, boyfriend, or girlfriend, it doesn't matter if they are someone's boss, servant, or hero. They always put on the same face in front of me — one that exhibits the reverence and fear for the Almighty Shogun.\nYet none know how I equally fear that very face of theirs. Who wouldn't? Just think about it: thousands of people putting on the same face in your presence.\n\nThat is why I rely so much on Masako.\nThat is why I couldn't reject her request. Although I can't do it, I will always go out to work as long as she wants me to.\nTo be honest, I don't know how to deal with those identical faces — thousands of them. I don't want to, and I can't. As long as I get to avoid making contact with them, I don't mind being called a loser Shogun.\nBut still, although I don't mind that, I can't face Masako's questions.\n\"Why are you so quiet, Almighty Shogun? Is it because... you did nothing at all after walking out of Tenshukaku and then came back in the evening?\" There was not a trace of reprimand to be heard in Masako's voice, but that made me even more ashamed when facing her questions.\n\"Alright then. Rest is also important. I have other matters to attend to, so I'll excuse myself. Enjoy your fill of the crab.\" Masako turns around and leaves.\n\nSomehow, the Butter Crab today tasted like... nothing.\nSoon I'll know why.\nThe Almighty Shogun is invincible, but the invincible Almighty Shogun could be defeated by a cold.\nNot long after I ate the Butter Crab, I collapsed into bed with a severe headache. The pain is nothing, but something more grievous has happened:\nOn any other day, I could just rest my head on Masako's knees and fall asleep to her singing voice.\nBut Masako isn't around today. My chamber feels icy-cold, but my forehead feels fiery-hot. This time, no one is sitting by my bedside.\n\nShe has her own matters to attend to. She is not only my kitsune but also the Guuji of the shrine.\nMaybe she is very mad now, or perhaps she is wondering if it is worthwhile to spend so much effort on the Shogun who always has the line \"Yay!\" upon her lips.\nWith such a question in mind, I fall asleep.\n\nI have a dream, in which Masako is still wearing her signature smile, a tea bowl in hand.\n\"I brewed this drink called Rainbow Aster. I just went to Ritou and bought some Calla Lilies from Mondstadt. Mix them with mint and we have this drink that can cure your cold. Now drink it.\"\nPerhaps because I am dreaming, I don't have the strength to brace myself up.\n\"Ah, looks like you can't support yourself. Allow me.\" She feeds me the Rainbow Aster in a way that I'd never dare to imagine.\nI wake with a start, my head still reeling from the sheer shock of the scene just now. Masako is probably still mad at me for slacking off.\n\nIt's just...

What if we built a huge spinning, ball-shaped cell in the center of the valley and threw all of the hilichurls into it? That way we might be able to generate enough energy to power all the mills in Mondstadt for at least five years. If we took it one step further by grinding the hilichurls that are too old or too weak into food and feeding them to the strong ones, we might just build ourselves a perpetual motion machine that can support a huge factory like in Snezhnaya!\nIt seems totally feasible to me.\nBut when I told Miss Lisa about this idea, she just looked at me and pondered in silence for a long time, then changed the subject gracefully.\n\nStarsnatch Cliff\n\nThe Anemo Archon is a bit too undisciplined for me. If I were a god, I would not have allowed my realm to look so unorganized and ragged. With enough bombs placed in proper positions, even huge cliffs like Starsnatch would crumble into dust in a second. With flatter terrain, Mondstadt would surely look much nicer.\nBut that unctuous Cavalry Captain rejected my proposal instantly. He even asked me to stay away from Starsnatch Cliff.\n\nWindrise\n\nWindrise is the only area in Mondstadt that has a relatively flat terrain. At the center there is a huge oak tree. It is said that Vennessa ascended there. I searched around the tree for a long time but did not find any launching device.\nI grabbed some hilichurls nearby to put my theory to the test. Sadly, the longest flying distance was from here to the hunters' huts around Springvale. How disappointing.\n\nFalcon Coast\n\nMy unsuccessful experiment caused quite a stir in Springvale, so Miss Jean from the Knights of Favonius arranged someone to keep tabs on me. All I could do all day was wander around at Falcon Coast. This is such a boring place. Those stupid eagles hovering in the sky and puffed-up Anemo Slimes all bored me to death! The worst of all was that I had nothing to do!\nOn the other hand, the Outrider girl who was sent to monitor me had quite a lot of fun with the kids.\n\nWhispering Woods\n\nYet another forest in Mondstadt. This Outrider named Amber seemed to know her way around this place. The explosive toy she carried around caught my attention.

But an explosive stuffed toy is indeed a brilliant idea.\nI must try it out next time.\n\nBrightcrown Canyon\n\nI finally got rid of that stalker from the Knights of Favonius. This valley I found at the northwest coast of Cider Lake is still guarded by ancient mechanisms, but the soldiers responsible for holding the pass for the King of Gales were nowhere to be found now. All the winds of time had left behind were the unintelligent hilichurls and silent mechanical guards.\nMy attempt to control Ruin Guards with hilichurls failed as well. The guard split into pieces, and as for the fate of the hilichurl strapped onto it... I will spare you the gory details. Half of the ruins were also destroyed in the process.\n\nStormterror's Lair\n\nBrightcrown Canyon leads to this huge ruin of an ancient city which was built by the cruel King of Gales, Decarabian. The city was built in a ring shape. It seems that every resident of the city had been arranged their own spot between the inner and outer rings. Right in the center of the city was the tall tower where the King of Gales resided.\nThe ruins of the domain of this cruel king, who once tried to control his people's lives, are now utterly deserted.\nI blew up a few arcades so people can climb up the tower more easily.

They even prepared dry clothes and some food for me.\nThere were many children in Qingce Village. Sweet as they may be, they can become quite clingy. There were also many elders here. People living here seemed happy and carefree. The elders said that most of the young people had gone to work in Liyue Harbor.

Having seen the prosperity and convenience of the city, it's hard for these young people to go back to the rural life here. Liyue Harbor has brought peace and prosperity to Qingce Village for the time being, but eventually it will also be the cause of its demise.\nLegend has it that the word \"Qingce\" originated from the name of an ancient monster \"Chi.\" \"Chi,\" of course, is what we call it now in the contemporary language. But in ancient times, the people of Liyue pronounced it as \"Qingce.\"\nAn elder said that thousands of years ago, Morax defeated the sea serpent and brought peace back to Liyue. After Chi died, its body turned to stone, its blood became water, and its scales are now the terraced fields. The monster's nest became what we now call Mt.

The sight gave me much to think about.\nA wanderer's leisure is not the tradition of our clan, but the appreciation of scenery surely counts. I believe it was Great Grandfather who started that particular practice.\nYou mentioned that he enjoyed planting small trees, loving their supple branches, while Grandfather was of a different temperament, enjoying fiddling with stones more.\nWhen I was young, our backyard was full of the many curious stones that Grandfather collected. Back then, I thought the ground was littered with treasure, but now that I know much more of the world, I can be quite certain that at least some of them were sword-testing stones that Grandfather brought back from the forging station.\nI knew precious little about stones then, believing them all to be of great value.\nBut can there really be so much treasure in life?\n...I am writing this letter as I rest in a shady spot on a hilltop.\nI intend to burn this letter shortly, before using the water from a mountain stream to quench the remnant embers.

Here I leave the record of all I know for future generations to see and learn from my experiences.\n\nNote 2:\nMy comrades and myself were ordered by the Qixing to take the Fantastic Compass to The Chasm and assist our Millelith champions. But the beasts in this place were incredibly terrifying, and our forces suffered terrible losses. If not for the aid of the yaksha, I fear that my brother and I might have been slain right there and then.\n\nNote 3:\nThis yaksha has four hands and behaves in a maddened fashion, even being unable to remember his own name. When in a crazed state, he refers to others around him as \"Alatus\" and \"Menogias.\" He has mastery over the thunder, and his form is awe-inspiring — one that is destined to be remembered throughout history. We followed him into battle against the wicked beasts for ten-odd days, finally breaking out.\n\nNote 4:\nA snake has its weakness seven inches below the head, and these monsters naturally have their weakness as well. Having discovered this, the yaksha has decided on a battle plan to target that weakness. In our previous battle, the surface of The Chasm was damaged, revealing a great and enigmatic underground palace in the bowels of the earth.\nWe observed that the monsters would grow weak when approaching this domain, and so we guessed that there is some power there that greatly suppresses these beasts of Khaenri'ah.\n\nNote 5:\n...We have suffered too many losses. We must end this quickly. Rongzhao and I agreed that I would take the Fantastic Compass and lead a group of Millelith to follow the yaksha down into the underground palace. We will lure the beasts away and herd them into the depths of the palace.\nThe seal... must be completed by myself and the yaksha within that place, with Rongzhao aiding us from the outside. That way, we can ensure that the seal will hold. If this works, The Chasm front will be secured. However, this means that I, the yaksha, and the Millelith with us will be left behind within the underground palace. Yet... the benefits are too great. We have to try this out.\n\nNote 6:\nThe warriors have observed day and night, and have confirmed that the beasts are heavily limited once they enter the underground palace, almost as if some power is eating away at them.\nSome of our wounded have sacrificed themselves, and others have split off from the main party in their confusion, never to return. Will the monsters... really be vanquished in this way?\n\nNote 7:\nThe unmatched strangeness of the underground palace is something I fear only I and the yaksha still live to witness. I do not know how much time has passed. The yaksha is gravely wounded and maddened. I fear he will not live long. As for me, though I remain clear-headed, I can feel fey moods setting in.\nI do not know how long I have been here. The yaksha urges me to depart, forgetting that staying here was the fate we chose.\n\nNote 8:\nThe underground palace is almost like a living being. When a breach first appeared in the ground, we leapt down below and gave battle, but even then I noticed that the breach was quietly closing. I'm not sure if that was the only tactic we could have chosen...\nAnd even when we attack the rifts, the rent-open spaces slowly regenerate. Well, they only regenerate slowly sometimes. Other times they can be swift — it is hard to say. Does this mean that when we damaged the ground in the fighting, we damaged the outer shell of this space? ... Have we accidentally entered the belly of some mighty leviathan, only to be slowly devoured by it?\n\nNote 9:\nI believe that this should be the end of those wicked beasts. We have outlasted them all. I have tried many paths. There is no way out. The yaksha has fallen. Only I remain.\nI see my family, my wife, my children... They approach me — and then they pass through. I must be going mad! How else could I be seeing my family, who are in Liyue Harbor... I wish I could go home...

He started with a poem — \"Jade-lustered waves washed into the ocean while a conch lay empty on the white shoal.\"\nThe meaning of the poem is that the sunlight, pure as jade, glimmers on the surface of the Bishui River and seems to flow into the sea along with the river water. But the Greenconch Lodge on the Yaoguang Shoal has been unoccupied for some time.\nI once ventured into the fog to visit the Seashell Sanctuary, but didn't see the owner.\nA legend among fishermen has it that the Greenconch Lodge was the home of an adeptus — the green conch itself, in fact, constituting part of her very being. She provided shelter for travelers who were lost in the fog, took care of the shipwrecked survivors, and bid godspeed to other adepti on crusades against sea monsters.\nBut older fishermen interpret the legend differently.

Yet, does the substance of his dream back up his claim?\nWicked Dragon: Oh... hmm. (The dragon looks Servant A up and down with a perplexed expression.)\nServant A: Oh! And the beast is silent! Is my dream so grand that even a dragon finds it difficult to consume?\n\nNarrator: As the noble warrior faced off against the evil dragon, the anxious princess and her entourage arrived at last.\nNarrator: The nameless servant kept his eyes on the field. The warrior's words have ignited a fire within his heart.\n(Leon takes the field and gazes upon Servant A, talking to himself.)\n\nLoyal Servant: I admire his fearless figure. It would be a dream to also one day prove my character.\n\nServant A: Evil dragon! Why do you not speak? Have you finally realized you should cower in fear?\nWicked Dragon: I care not for those who are lesser. Your dream is massive, yet hollow in nature. For now, this wi— enlightened dragon still cannot decide if it's fit to eat...\nServant A: How vile of you to humiliate me, just because I am an enemy!\nServant A: I regarded you as a worthy opponent, yet you use such insidious tactics!\nServant A: I, the world-famous fighter, will never fall before your degradation and trickery. You disgust me! (Servant A advances, intending to do battle with the wicked dragon, but the dragon yawns deeply and groggily instead.)\n\nNarrator: The fighter's animated speech kindled a burning flame within even the oft-dispassionate heart of the royal lady.\n(The valiant princess takes the stage! This stage does not much highlight her brilliance, but keep the spotlight on her nonetheless. Also, bear in mind that \"kindled a burning flame even within the oft-dispassionate heart\" is mere metaphor, and does not refer to truly setting the stage on fire. That said, is there some way to change the lights to a shade of red? Perhaps the judicious application of some Valberry juice might do the trick...)\nPrincess: I am long tired of my peaceful boudoir, I wish to fight alongside my soldiers!\n\nWicked Dragon: Though one sees little reason to teach a lesson, perhaps no choice is left in the matter.\nWicked Dragon: Too many appetizers before the dish ruins the mood, but just for today, I can entertain an early platter.\nNarrator: To everyone's shock, the evil dragon then swallowed the fighter's dream in one big gulp.\n(A dark light shines forth from Servant A's armor. The dragon raises both wings on high and leans down, absorbing it all! Servant A falls to the ground bonelessly, his sword discarded, his expression stunned. However, please take note to fall lightly so the backdrops are not tipped over by the impact. Servant A is wearing armor, after all.)\n\nWicked Dragon: It is just as I thought. Thin and crunchy, though empty under its shell. A most marvelous texture.\n(The dragon licks its lips in satisfaction, beats its wings, and departs.)\nPrincess: The warrior was handily defeated! So he was a gifted orator, but never a true fighter.\nLoyal Servant: Conceit became his downfall. His power did not match his stature.\nNarrator: The dragon remained unsatiated. Under everyone's gaze, it flew away to parts unfamiliar.\n(End Scene. The Princess stands in the middle of the stage until the curtain is pulled up, all the better for the audience to witness her glorious form!)\n\nInterlude II\n(The banners fly bravely outside the royal gates, making for a majestic sight indeed. The Wicked Dragon flies onstage from a window and lands before the gate, examining its surroundings. While landing on the walls themselves would have a greater visual effect, the various scenery props will likely not take the dragon's wait, so it is best to just land in front of the gate!)\n\nNarrator: The dragon flew off, and briefly rested at the gate.\nWicked Dragon: Where are the guards? Are they too terrified to face their fate?\n\nNarrator: As the evil dragon made no attempts to move or hide, the princess and her entourage quickly arrived.\nNarrator: The princess' loyal knight was the first to spot the creature, for he always rode far ahead.\n(Leon takes the stage and monologues to the audience.)\nLoyal Servant: (firmly) How dare the dragon be insolent as such! I pledged before the king, to not let the princess come to harm.\nLoyal Servant: (slightly worried) Mayhap our tactician can succeed with his wits and charm.\nLoyal Servant: Legends have it that he's the ultimate survivor.\nLoyal Servant: If he can ward against dangers with fastidious care, we need not recklessly suffer.\nLoyal Servant: Without a plan, we should not pull the trigger.\nNarrator: The loyal servant passed the message in a voice barely higher than a whisper.\nNarrator: \"While the evil dragon rests, we will draw up a plan.\"\nNarrator: Upon those words, she approached carefully, so the dragon would ignore her steps.\n(The princess takes the stage, standing beside Leon, speaking to the audience.)\n\nPrincess: The tactician is correct. We require a plan before we fight.\nPrincess: Thanks to my servant's far-sighted work, we have seized the initiative.\nLoyal Servant: Your highness honors me, I was simply doing my duty.\nPrincess: Placing the saddle on the right horse is the way of the world. Take your praise with pride.\nPrincess: The tactician has fallen behind. Why does he falter? Did he get entangled in a struggle?\nLoyal Servant: He promised to quell all draconic cataclysms. Perhaps he is torn between myriad schemes.\n\nNarrator: Through all faith and cynicism, the cautious tactician remained silent, his face one of dismay and gloom.\n(Servant B enters, his face fearful and nervous.)\nServant B: ...\nLoyal Servant: O tactician, the dragon beckons. Please enlighten us about the stratagem.\nServant B: S—Stratagem? No stratagem can be perfected so quickly for a situation this grave. More time is vital...\nWicked Dragon: Haha, this merciful enlightened one shall grant thee all the time in the world. Only at dusk will I call the dust to settle.\n(The wicked dragon, once crawling before the city gate, now raises its head and breathes fire toward the skies! Be careful not to burn the flags, since the stage props are not fireproof, so a real fire would be trouble and then some.)\n\nPrincess: Hark, the evil dragon speaks! It was simply feigning sleep to lure us into peril!\nServant B: Aah!\n(Servant B pales greatly and flees stumbling offstage. Everyone seems stunned by this turn of events.)\nNarrator: Attendant B shook where he stood, stopping just short from falling to his knees.\nNarrator: He muttered and apologized, then ran away to the gate without hesitation.\nNarrator: The princess and her loyal servant rushed off to find him, while the dragon broke into laughter.\nWicked Dragon: (disdainfully) If the king had chosen to appease me, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy such a scene!\n\nNarrator: Leaving behind her tactician-seeking servant, the princess returned alone to keep the dragon under guard.\n(Even if the princess has no lines, the spotlight should be on her nonetheless.)\nPrincess: (facing the audience, monologuing) If a mirage belies the tactician's wisdom, what may I call on to keep my kingdom safe?\nPrincess: The element of surprise fades; the dragon now lies calmly in wait.\nPrincess: The tactician has lost his nerve, yet my servant followed in pursuit.\nPrincess: Shockingly, open city gates greet me where guards should have stood.\n\nNarrator: An old guard arrived. Though he was quite visibly drunk, his footsteps were surprisingly steady.\n(The Old Guard enters.)\nOld Guard: *Hic* If you ask me, this time of peace is truly fantastic, what with food, wine and beauties!\nOld Guard: The aristocrats have never known our hardships, the searing sun and the chilling wind!\nOld Guard: Dragons? Tacticians? What a boatload of nonsense!\nOld Guard: My eyes are dim now, and my ears ring. Why did they send me out to the front lines to take on a dragon?\n\nNarrator: Though the young guard learned much from his senior, he hasn't forgotten his wish to defend the kingdom.\n(Young Guard enters.)\nYoung Guard: F—For the princess, I must fight!\nYoung Guard: With everyone gone, I am the last line of defense!\nYoung Guard: I must save the kingdom from ruin and defeat this gluttonous dragon!\nYoung Guard: (draws blade) Wicked Dragon! Have you anything to say before I fell you here and now?\nWicked Dragon: (happily) Haha, very well, very well! Let this enlightened one see if you have any battle prowess to back up that shout!\n(The dragon takes to the skies again, looming over the young guard, who seizes up a bow and arrows and fires at the former. Just go through the motions, don't fire actual arrows, or we might get in trouble if they hit people!)\n\nNarrator: The loyal servant finally returned just as the terrible fight was about to break out.\n(Leon comes up quickly. At this point, the focus of the audience will still be on the young guard and the dragon, so make sure to put a spotlight on Leon.)\nLoyal Servant: The tactician's trail fades, but the guard should carry his weight.\nLoyal Servant: No, I should have led him into battle, I was still way too late!\nNarrator: The late arrival let out a resigned sigh even as the dragon raised the stakes.\n(The evil dragon rushes the young guard with inexorable force. The guard throws down the bow and arrows and draws his sword instead, hurrying to meet the foe. The two trade blows, but the young guard is ultimately no match for the dragon and is repelled by it. Pouncing, the dragon swallows the dark light flowing from the guard's armor. The special effects here must be special indeed. For example, get the dragon to careful breathe just a little fire when its claws and the guard's blade clash, just to imitate sparks flying every which way...)\n\nNarrator: Though the young guard fought with valor, the cunning dragon still snapped up the prize in one take.\nYoung Guard: *sob* If I had worked harder during training, I wouldn't feel so helpless today...\n\nWicked Dragon: Though my appetite remains healthy, you did well to quench my cravings.\nWicked Dragon: The portions were modest, yet the taste remained rather satisfying.\nWicked Dragon: If the appetizers had already entertained me so, surely the main dish would cast a spell.\nNarrator: Thus again satisfied, the proud dragon licked its mouth and leisurely flew off.\n(The wicked dragon exits once more, and everyone watches as it departs. Scene end.)\n\nInterlude III\n(Village on the city outskirts, as the scene opens, wood can be lit backstage to imitate the smoky atmosphere.)\n\nNarrator: Still vowing to defeat the dragon, the princess followed the trail.\nNarrator: The servant continued at his pace, shouldering all burdens without fail.\nNarrator: Though the slayer scorned the servant, the loyal man paid it no mind.\n(Leon, carrying a luxurious and heavy treasure chest, struggles to get onstage.)\nLoyal Servant: If I bore his tools and freed his mind, perhaps a victory he shall find.\nLoyal Servant: He bears the sword of destiny, the blade of the chosen one.\nLoyal Servant: He will raise it before the dragon, and victory will follow in time.\n\n(The dragon flies in from afar and roars, setting the sunset backdrop alight with its breathed flames. Make sure the fireproof platforms for the sunset scene have been installed correctly. If they have not, just take the sunset scene down altogether to prevent safety incidents and the audience lawsuits that will surely ensue.)\nNarrator: As if hearing his thoughts, the dragon descended upon a village.\nWicked Dragon: Let me see, let me find. Is my golden dream right at hand?\n\n(Servant C arrives on stage behind Leon, relaxed and carrying no burden.)\nServant C: O dragon, no one would laugh at you if you were to flee in fear!\nWicked Dragon: The human realizes not how comical he and his words appear.\nServant C: Wise and merciful as I am, I will refrain from taking the bait.\nServant C: However, I pray you will live to regret what you say.\nWicked Dragon: Haha, for a dull human, you sure have a sharp tongue.\nWicked Dragon: Let's see it, then, if among heroes you truly belong.\n\nNarrator: The princess has also finally caught up with her attendants.\n(The spotlight roves around the stage once before landing on the princess. Yes, the fearless princess has at last taken the stage once again!)\nPrincess: It should be my duty to banish the dragon.\nServant C: Your Highness, your permission to charge.\nServant C: With my blade and extensive experience, I will take this dragon apart.\nPrincess: Permission granted. Be on your guard.\nServant C: I once slew a poisonous dragon, and took this most precious reward. (Displays his mantle)\nServant C: This cloak lets me evade any type of regard.\n(While the audience is distracted by the mantle, Servant C disappears!)\n\nServant C: (within) I will bide my time, and find the moment to strike the heart.\n\nWicked Dragon: Ah, and here I thought you were privy to some special art.\nWicked Dragon: Did you plan to flee all along, and have only been waiting for a chance to depart? Hmm?\n\nNarrator: If the slayer put on his cloak and walked into the crowd, who would be able to tell him apart?\nServant C: Dragon, how dare you slander my name?\nServant C: Despite my patience and mercy, you have shown no shame.\nServant C: Bitter regret will be yours after I take aim.\nWicked Dragon: By all means, please go on. This enlightened one cannot wait to play your game.\nServant C: L—Let's take it over there!\nNarrator: Silently acknowledging the request, the dragon twisted its features into a benevolent smile.\n(Scene End. After this, the stage backdrop should be changed a little. Remember to put out the fires on the sunset decorations!)\n\nNarrator: In a flash, the dragon landed at the promised place.\nNarrator: The princess and her loyal servant immediately followed apace.\nNarrator: But the slayer remained rooted in place. Has he somehow lost his faith?\n\n(Servant C takes the stage and walks around a sword in the stone, but will not draw it.)\nServant C: ...Evil dragon, you'll see what I'm made of!\nServant C: I've climbed mountains, crossed lakes, traversed dungeons, and defeated your kin...\nServant C: To finally obtain this sword, the blade of fate.\nServant C: Leave now, otherwise this razor-sharp blade will cut you into pieces!\nWicked Dragon: Hahaha. What must be a shining myth to you is but trivial babble to me.\nWicked Dragon: I will settle and not even move two feet. Attack as you please.\n\nNarrator: Simple villagers gathered to witness the scene. Many were fascinated by the blade's myth.\nNarrator: A farmer came forward to try out the blade, but others wondered if hands that had only held a pitchfork could even grasp the hilt.\n(The farmer steps forth, throws down the pitchfork, and comes up to the blade.)\nFarmer: I consider myself a fit man, a match for knights from the palace.\n(The farmer attempts several times with all his might to pull the blade out, but it does not even budge an inch.)\nFarmer: Uh! I thought I was strong enough, but I couldn't even shake it.\nNarrator: The farmer used all his strength, but the sword remained in place.\nNarrator: As for the princess and her servant, they also declined to try their faith.\nNarrator: The dragon observed intently, but its patience finally wore away.\nWicked Dragon: (bored) Alas, I've grown tired of words and charades. When will a puny human finally save the day?\nWicked Dragon: Take the blade and strike me down, if you mean what you say!\nServant C: A—A mighty dragon slayer shan't do your bidding!\nWicked Dragon: A dragon slayer? You are but a charlatan.\nWicked Dragon: Drop your pretense and ask the child. Even he can see through you.\n\nNarrator: Could the dragon's words be true, and there is no true dream under those layers of armor?\n(A child walks onstage, looks at the dragon, then at Servant C.)\nChild: A dragon, bigger than those from the rhymes! But I won't be scared!\nChild: That shiny armor, why does it click? His mouth is open, why does he not speak?\n\nWicked Dragon: Though I'm not hungry, this snack's been delivered straight to my door!\nNarrator: The dragon's huge mouth instantly swallowed the slayer's dream.\n(Servant C stands where he is, rooted to the spot by utter terror, while the dragon flies up high before charging down at him. This descent must be at least fifty meters, and the dragon's roar must be enough to shake the stage. The dragon absorbs the dark light from Servant C's armor, upon which Servant C shall be left motionless, the sword in the stone cast aside. Please take care when chucking it, though, lest the stage props get damaged.)\n\nWicked Dragon: *chews* Hmph, it's just as I expected. Long rotten dreams make for terrible food.\nWicked Dragon: This bad apple taste... what a disgrace.\n(The dragon picks its teeth somewhat unhappily and departs from the village. The Loyal Servant and others are shocked, but the princess just sighs softly.)\n\nLoyal Servant: The slayer was also defeated!\nPrincess: So the tales of past battles did not hold up.\nNarrator: The dragon again departed the scene, leaving only the bewildered slayer in his wake.\n(Scene End. Only pull the curtains once the dragon has gotten far enough away, or the audience will not be able to keep their eyes on the princess.)\n\nFinale\n(Far outside the royal city, the princess and her loyal attendant come to the cavern where the dragon is resting.)\n\nPrincess: The sun's about to set, and the moon soon to rise.\nPrincess: Our time is almost up, but evil survives.\nPrincess: The famed attendants all took on the dragon, but they fell one by one.\nPrincess: I made a vow, when all of this began...\nPrincess: But now I fear, my vow has become a farce...\nLoyal Servant: As her most loyal servant, I should share her worries.\nLoyal Servant: I am a nobody, but thanks to her, I was given a place.\nLoyal Servant: Nevertheless, I admire the princess' diligence and kindness.\nLoyal Servant: Please, don't dwell in sadness. We can reflect on the trio's mistakes.\nPrincess: Your counsel is valid. Let me recall their words and deeds.\n\nNarrator: An inflated ego, yet falling at the first hurdle... the princess remembered what she'd seen.\n(Servant A enters, his head bowed in disgrace as he faces the audience. The spotlight is on him.)\nServant A: I fancied myself a fighter, but my enemy saw right through me. I overestimated my ability.\nServant A: I couldn't win against a strong enemy, but I also clung hard to my conceit.\nServant A: I lacked respect, because I feared others wouldn't respect me.\n(The spotlight returns to the princess.)\nPrincess: A dream that was massive in size, yet hollow inside.\nPrincess: Lots of guts, but no ability.\n\nNarrator: A supposedly foolproof plan, yet with no one to see it through... the princess remembered again.\n(Servant B enters, his terror evident as he faces the audience. The spotlight is on him.)\nServant B: To protect myself, I ran away and let others take my place.\nServant B: All my plans evaporated when I saw the dragon in front of me.\nServant B: I did survive everything, but every time, I did so by abandoning those standing next to me.\n(Return the spotlight to the princess again!)\nPrincess: He was a tactician with neither morals nor strategy.\nPrincess: It's natural to be cautious, but one who abandons their comrades is no hero.\n\nNarrator: Avoiding the present, and only speaking endlessly of past glories... the princess remembered one last time.\n(Servant C enters, shamefaced and squeamish as he faces the audience. The spotlight is on him.)\nServant C: My past has proved my deeds, my laurels should now be able to speak for me.\nServant C: To give my life now would be foolish. It's elementary to balance risk and benefits.\n(As the spotlight sweeps back to the princess, the three servants quietly exeunt.)\nPrincess: His past has faded, all he has now is his former glory.\nPrincess: The spirit has decayed. He has long forgotten the taste of his dream.\n\n(The princess lightly grasps her rapier and looks up to the distant sky.)\nPrincess: Ah, if they all failed to defeat the dragon, then I...\nPrincess: With only my dream and my rapier, how can I possibly defeat the dragon?\n(Leon walks up to the princess, nodding slightly to show his resolve.)\nLoyal Servant: Though I am but a lowly bystander in the palace...\nLoyal Servant: I know you to be humble and grounded.\nLoyal Servant: You are never selfish or merciless.\nLoyal Servant: All know you for your eagerness and diligence, your dreams that are no less than gold.\nLoyal Servant: Your Highness, please don't underestimate yourself. Believe in your golden ideals...\nServant: And that you will slay that dream-devouring dragon for good!\n(Scene ends. When the scene reopens, the dragon is on all fours in a cave, seeming rather distressed. The dragon must enter with extreme care. Do not knock the various props aside!)\n\nNarrator: It is almost night. The dragon has changed its name to \"the starving one.\"\nWicked Dragon: I've had snack after snack, but dinner still eludes me.\nWicked Dragon: Snacks are distractions; in the end, they have no true substance.\nWicked Dragon: What's more, some of these just made me feel sick.\nWicked Dragon: I'm afraid only a true golden dream can sufficiently quench my cravings.\n\n(Leon creeps back on stage. The wicked dragon, rubbing its belly, does not notice him.)\nNarrator: The loyal servant approached quietly to observe the dragon. For the princess, he will do any and everything.\nLoyal Servant: ...For my promise to the king...\nLoyal Servant: ...But also, to make her happy. Even if it seems impossible...\nLoyal Servant: Huh? The dragon looks strange, why is it covering its chest? Let's hear what it's mumbling...\nWicked Dragon: (monologue) I shouldn't have underestimated the humans, or been so gluttonous...\nWicked Dragon: Now that my stomach is churning, I have no strength left to face off against the king.\n\nNarrator: Overjoyed, the loyal servant rushed back to share the news.\n(Leon hurries offstage and returns with the princess, who is armed with her sword. The spotlight is upon her as she raises her weapon and confronts the wicked dragon!)\n\nPrincess: My heart is full of courage. I will wield my rapier with pride.\nLoyal Servant: (points at the dragon's chest) Look! There's a spot above its heart that isn't covered by scales!\nLoyal Servant: Take it down, while it's still weak!\nPrincess: Evil dragon! I challenge thee to protect my kingdom!\n(The princess leaps on high and makes to stab the dragon fatally in its heart. The dragon rises hurriedly and flaps its wings in an attempt to block the blow, but the princess leaps up its body and strikes true!)\nWicked Dragon: Ahhh! Filthy human!\nNarrator: With a fearless thrust, the princess fulfilled her pledge.\n(The dragon falls with a crash. Just use a sound effect for this, though, or else the stage will surely collapse!)\n\nPrincess: The world opens itself before those who do not forget their dreams and nobility.\nPrincess: Thank you as well, my loyal servant. You deserve a fitting reward.\nPrincess: In light of our recent trials, I will name you...\n(The princess points to her loyal servant and the latter begins to glow with a dark light. Many feathers descend from above upon the stage, and the servant twirls as he slowly ascends to the sky. Scene ends.)\n\nNarrator: The Shatterer of Despair, Flügel der Dunkelheit, Servant of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung!\nNarrator: Finally, the princess personally defeated the dragon, and peace returned to the kingdom.\nNarrator: All praise, all praise.\n"},{"id":"Book419","title":"Book419","filename":"Book419_EN.txt","text":"???"},{"id":"Book41","title":"Book41","filename":"Book41_EN.txt","text":"The stone peaks in Liyue have attracted the attention of many knights, but I'm not a fan of them.

Al-Ahmar, mighty yet bewildered, seized them from the silver night winds and quicksands of the desert, the mystical swirls of the ocean, and the tinkling springs in the rainforest, and kept them in silver bottles. He was like an arrogant conqueror, and at the same time, a curious child.\n\nAl-Ahmar harnessed the spirits with bridles and yokes, learned from their laments about the story of the dismal moon and the driving morning star, and built the majestic Ay-Khanoum — the \"City of Amphitheaters,\" or \"City of the Moon Maiden\" — to commemorate them. It is said to have been the city of the spirits, the paradise for migrants from the moon, gifted to them by Al-Ahmar. In return, the spirits constructed the huge doorway to his mausoleum.\n\nThis is the tale as the desert singers would tell it. Countless years later, Ay-Khanoum — like Saleh, the city of the valiant Thamudians, Tulaytullah, the land of the wise Tighnarians, and Orghana, the city of the Twenty-Nine Deys — has long been buried beneath heavy sands and swirling currents, as have the countless clans that inhabited it and the innumerable Jinn imprisoned in their silver magic bottles.\n\nBut now, let us leave the unnecessary fact-finding to one side and return to the subject...\n\nFifteen years after Port Ormos was built, a young shepherd found a silver bottle in the Gravelsong Dunes (Note 1). Whether out of childish curiosity or a recklessness uncharacteristic of desert dwellers, the boy broke the seal beneath the silver bottle and opened it beneath the moonlight. (Note 2)\n\n\"The ravens of the mortal world are so exceptionally noisy...\"\nA Jinni arose from within the bottle (Note 3) in the form of a dancer, as flexible and languid as a cat and as bright and beautiful as a water lily.\n\"Ravens...?\"\nThe youth was clueless, as he did not resemble a bird, nor was he noisy.\n\"Yes, ravens.\"\nThe spirit repeated, rather impatiently.\n\"Birds that live fast and die fast, a noisy lot and no mistake... 'Only when they die do they wake up.' What about this is there to not understand, hmm?\"\nThe young man shook his head in confusion, bringing a sigh to the spirit's lips.\n\"Listen, foolish bird.\"\nThe spirit shook her head, her myrrh-scented braids swaying gently in the moonlight, the golden bells dangling at their ends ringing dreamily, but her amber eyes glinting like daggers.\n\n\"I will allow you to ask three questions under three conditions...\"\n\"First, do not defame my lord Al-Ahmar. This is my bottom line. (Note 4)\"\n\"Second, harbor you no arrogance. Short-lived mortals should know where they stand.\"\n\"Third, do not pry into the affairs of heaven and earth. Know this: there are indeed brave guardians and splendid stars in heaven.\"\n\"If you fail to comply, I will fly into your mouth and nose on the night wind, like the three moon goddesses on their steeds, draw out your guts and soul, and make your lifeless flesh my new home.\"\n\nThe youngster hastened to cover his mouth and nose, nodding profusely to show that he understood the conditions.\n\n\"Then ask, beloved child of my lord, slave of heaven.\"\nSaid the spirit, chuckling. The bright moonlight fell on her braids, and flowed into her nearly transparent skin, granting it a crystalline sheen. \n\"Who are you?\"\nThe young man asked.\n\"I'm a creation of the sky, yet also a creature of this world. I'm an exile of the ages, a faithful servant to my great lord. I'm an elemental spirit who will not bow to flesh and blood, an eternal prisoner content with the illusion of comfort...\"\nThe spirit held her head up high with pride, letting moonlight flow through her translucent body, her golden bells ringing in the desert wind.\n\"As a descendant of Liloufar, I can be big or small. I can rise or hide. My kindred may be found in the waves, in the night wind, or in the pale light of the dead moon. In short, I'm a spirit, and I'm proud of who I am.\"\n\"Then why are you in this bottle?\"\nThe young man shook the silver bottle in his hand and asked uncomprehendingly.\n\"My lord Al-Ahmar aspired to conquer the world. All mountains and seas would be his to command. To this end, he made us magic bottles of silver and stamped his mark on us, and so we became his servants, engaging in noble deeds of creation and exploration. In other words... we were not servants in shame, but servants with pride.\"\n\"But afterwards...\"\nThe spirit said quietly, her amber eyes darkening.\n\"My lord brought disaster upon himself, leaving us sentenced to generations of oblivion. We were trapped in sealed silver bottles, drowning in dreams until the moment of our death.\"\n\n\"Well, your third question, then!\"\nThe spirit waved her hand briskly, causing a clear jingle of the ancient silver coins adorning her wrists.\n\"Have a care for your query, or your mouth and nose will suffer!\"\n\"So...\"\nThe young man hesitated for a moment, and asked the last question.\n\"What's it like to live in a bottle?\"\n\nSeemingly having never heard of such a question before, the spirit was slightly surprised before she answered slowly.\n\n\"In the first era, I lived in a carefree palace, singing with nightingales and talking with roses. It was a beautiful time, a time when poets and lovers were born because of me. In those days, it seemed that the entire City of the Moon Maiden was in the bottle, and even the tasteless spring water was intoxicating.\"\n\"At that time, I told myself that if anyone ever broke the seal and let me out into the outside world, I would curse and kill them.\"\n\n\"In the era that came after, sandstorms and demons ran riot. Nightingales sang till their voice grew raspy and their blood dried up. Roses withered and turned into tangles of thorns. Poets died of maltreatment, lovers were displaced, prosperity vanished... It was a dreadful time when everything came to a standstill in the eternal collapse.

The grand play of the City of the Moon Maiden came to an end, and what remained were the ruined theater and the wrecked masks of the gods. In that era, I ran out of tears to shed, and the chiming golden bells and the fluttering veil became to me a haunting curse.\"\n\"And so, I told myself amidst that desolation that if anyone ever broke the seal and let me out into the outside world, I would turn into an evil seeking revenge — I would destroy the world, or else destroy myself.\"\n\n\"So...\"\nA gust of cold wind in the desert sent a shiver over the young man, causing him to tighten his loose robe.\n\n\"Yes, I could have made you the first target of my revenge... tore your bones and flesh to make a cruel song of your soul.\"\nThe spirit smiled teasingly, like a nightingale announcing a death on a summer night.\n\"Yet the dead moon cast a glow over the quicksand dunes, and over me... and I suddenly realized how lovely the world is.\"\n\"And so this poor Jinni, like a chick struggling to break through its egg, has hopelessly fallen in love with this barren and ravaged world and its circle of life and death.

This is the desert area that the Eremites often refer to as \"Dar al-Azif.\" This does not refer to a fixed place, since the dunes themselves flow like the wind.\n2.

Faramaraz, a Purbiruni academic, has argued that the word \"rise\" was inappropriate here and that a better word should be used to present the image of \"pouring out like a radiant cloud of smoke.\" It must be admitted that his opinion has literary merit, but it will not be adopted academically.

Faramaraz, a Purbiruni academic, has pointed out that \"Al-Ahmar\" was not the name that the monarch used during his lifetime, and that it is improper to quote it here.

The moonlit silver coins jangled on her wrists and ankles as if displeased with the jouncing of the Sumpter Beast.\n\"Anyway, little raven, do you know the meaning of the name \"Shiruyeh\"?\"\n\n\"Uh... 'One who is ridiculous and despicable'?\"\nThe youth whom she had rather one-sidedly named \"Raven\" answered casually. Suffering the heat of the sun and the threat of quicksand, he had little interest in his travel companion's stories.\n\"In our tribe, 'Shiruyeh' is a disgraceful name branded only onto the foreheads of exiled chiefs and spoken only in curses and mockery. It's a tradition of ours... But I'm sure that the traditions of other tribes are not so different.\"\n\n\"Haha! Mortal awareness is just like quicksand, shifting with the winds of time. How bizarre!\"\n\"Raven\" replied perfunctorily, drawing an unexpectedly enthusiastic taunt from the fairy,\n\"Now, actually... in the lost language, 'Shiruyeh' means 'unweaned lion cub'. His father Parvezravan gave this name to his newborn son, oblivious that he, the vassal king who referred to himself as the 'Spirit of Unceasing Victory,' would be torn apart by his own beloved 'lion cub'...\"\n\nThe fairy paused, seemingly afraid that her audience was getting bored, and exchanged glances with the youth before continuing her tale:\n\"As for this Parvezravan, legend has it that in the days when mortals ruled as vassal kings, he was one of the mightiest among them...\"\n\n\"Parvezravan was not, in fact, the original name of this vassal king. As the spirits tell it, he was an orphan who was raised in the nest of the giant bird Ghoghnus and given the name 'Kisra,' or 'one who has been bestowed a good name.' Later, his aspiration to greatness and the aid of this divine bird saw him adopted by the vassal king Ormazd Shah, and he would eventually rise to become a sage and hero among mortals.\n\nIn the songs of the now-vanished desert people, Kisra plundered the four corners of the land in the name of his king, Ormazd Shah. By his hand, the bronze and mortar towers of ninety-nine cities were destroyed or abandoned. By his hand, the leaders of ninety-nine nomadic tribes were defeated. And by his hand, ninety-nine sages with knowledge of the order of the stars were bound in golden chains, then led back to the towering royal city of Gurabad to be imprisoned.\n\nAt that time, the promised land of \"Valivija\" was engulfed by wild, gilded sands, and one of the three living gods had fallen. Amidst a century of chaos and confusion, the scattered mortals ensconced themselves in vassal states until my lord Al-Ahmar and the Sage-King of the Greenwood gathered their subjects. Once the oasis paradise was reconstructed, the age of the vassal kings, the age of division, finally came to a close.\n\nReturning to our preceding tale, Ormazd's crown grew all the more valuable on the back of Kisra's exploits, until finally his own neck could no longer bear its weight, forcing him to leave it ever suspended from chains of pure gold in the center of the main hall.\n\nThe vassal king Ormazd Shah rewarded young Kisra's unrivaled achievements amply: He bestowed the name \"Parvez\" upon his adopted son and offered his daughter Shirin's hand to him in marriage. In the ethereal songs of the spirits, as the heir of both the mortal vassal king and the foremother Liloufar, she possessed superior wisdom and was blessed with an infinite lifespan and, like the original sages, could foresee the fortunes and misfortunes of the present moment.\n\nIf Kisra Parvez had stopped there, his reputation as a hero would have continued unblemished. But one cursed day, Ormazd and all 300 of his offspring suddenly died in one night in the city of Gurabad. Following such an unthinkable event, the throne naturally fell to Kisra, who added \"Ravan\" to his title and became the most powerful vassal king among mortals.\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe fairy abruptly stopped her tale and looked up at the red sun that was now sinking behind the sand dunes. She then whistled sharply, signaling to the youth to halt the Sumpter Beast and prepare to make camp for the night under the crumbling stone pillars.\n\n\"Some people say...\"\nThe fairy lithely leaped down from the Sumpter Beast and circled across the sands in a manner not unlike the long-lost dancers of Setaria, letting the moon's first light evenly coat her translucent skin in its silvery sheen. The scent of myrrh swirled around her myriad braids as the golden bells rang out into the distance.\nThen, the fairy leaned over slightly, balancing on the tips of her toes as she laughed softly.\n\nSome people say that the tragedy that befell the city of Gurabad was the handiwork of the hero Kisra.\nSome people say that the night the tragedy took place, an evil, clawless bird flew out from the redoubt and wailed throughout the night without stopping to eat or drink. The castle was then struck by a plague of rats with human faces, which gnawed at the gold chains from which the crown hung, causing the cumbersome thing to crash heavily to the ground, broken and bent.\nPeople say that the crown made such an earth-shaking noise when it fell that even the Fellahin servants, who had settled and toiled far from the redoubt, trembled with fear at this tyrant they had never met.\nLater still, it is said that an adventurer found the ancient crypts of the city of Gurabad beneath the gilded sands, in which were hidden the withered, massive remains of Ormazd and his offspring, An ancient, inscrutable inscription was left on each of the shriveled bodies...\n\n\"I hope this story frightened you.\"\nThe fairy watched keenly as the mortal boy before her drank from the waterskin.\nThe tribes of the desert regard water with an instinctive restraint and prudence. Spirits, however, are born of pure elemental energy and know neither thirst nor the satisfaction of the pleasure of luxury, just like the ancient princess Shirin in this lament.\n\n\"As for the daughter of the foremother Liloufar I mentioned, Shirin — why, our story has only just begun...\"\nThe fairy smiled slyly again, her eyes like an amalgam of amber and gold, her smiling face like the princess of her ancient homeland.\n"},{"id":"Book428","title":"Book428","filename":"Book428_EN.txt","text":"At that time, the promised land of \"Valivija\" was engulfed by wild, gilded sands, and one of the three living gods had fallen. Amidst a century of chaos and confusion, the scattered mortals ensconced themselves in vassal states until my lord Al-Ahmar and the Sage-King of the Greenwood gathered their subjects. Once the oasis paradise was reconstructed, the age of the vassal kings, the age of division, finally came to a close.\n\n\"Yes, you've mentioned this part of the story already.\"\nThe youth's tone was rather impatient as he gazed at the full moon hanging in the starry sky, using the positions of its companion stars to determine the next day's route.\nBut the spirit knew that he was, in truth, listening earnestly to her story. She couldn't refrain from letting out a triumphant snort, but was immediately annoyed by this unbecoming action:\n\"The mortal mind is as fickle as it is forgetful. How should I know whether you were listening or not?\"\n\nBack to the subject at hand — Shirin, according to the spirits' lamentations, was the daughter of the mortal hero Ormazd and the fairy Liloufar, the Daughter of the Water Lily. Born upon a lily pad amid fragrant dewdrops, the white ibis blessed her, and the cobra bequeathed to her a cerulean pearl, and even the mighty giant crocodile bowed to her in worship.\nAs the foremother of the spirits, before she delivered her daughter to the mortal vassal king, Liloufar prophesied three times: First, that Shirin would fall in love with a great hero, and the progeny of their union would surpass their father. Second, that many of Shirin's relatives would enjoy a sweet end, and third, that Shirin alone would be given possession of her father's kingdom.\nThen, Liloufar gave three admonitions to her mortal darling: First, that her joy would bring tears to her father's eyes. Second, that they should no longer feast at the same table as their daughter after she was wed, and third, that their daughter's heir would be an ill omen upon the king's land.\n\nThe king, however, only smiled at these prophecies and admonitions.\n\n\"Later, Shirin's father offered her hand in marriage to the great hero 'Parvezravan,' fulfilling the first prophecy, right?\"\nThe youth said, interrupting the spirit's story.\n\n\"That's correct, though, not entirely so...\"\nThe spirit laid a finger on the tip of the youth's nose and the latter hurriedly moved away, his face flushed as if he feared she might put some ethereal, deathly curse on him. The spirit once again found herself amused by such an innocent act.\n\nBy the time Shirin grew a little older and more cognizant, the vision her mother laid out for her became a lingering curse. She spent her days awaiting her chance to fall in love with a hero, waiting for the day when she would inherit her father's kingdom, and longing for that sweet and perfect future — but it never came.\n\nTruth be told, Shirin's marriage to the hero Kisra was not a happy one — after all, mortal heroes are all warped people harboring the ambition to rule. The daughter of Liloufar carried the pride of the spirits, and thus she found the golden trap of the mortal hero's supposed affections hard to endure, and she found no peace between the bed and the hearth. And so at last, a vivid hatred coalesced from this passionless, dull, rotten life — the same hatred that those imprisoned in the silver bottle carry.\n\nLater, on the night of the infamous grand banquet, a few lowly slaves — mages of the Mazandaran Oasis, or perhaps some illiterate Fellahin servants — dripped scorpion venom into musk honey and offered it to the vassal king Ormazd and his 300 heirs. They then watched as they sunk into the sweet, dreamless landscape of death, drowning in the fat and blood of the wretched as their blood and tears flowed freely...\nAnd on this night, all who remained with dreams left to enjoy were Shirin, who had been excluded from the party by her own father, and her reluctant co-conspirator and husband, Kisra.\nThe lowly regicides were thereupon submerged in the honey pot as punishment by the new king, and they cursed him with their last breaths as they choked on the sticky honey.\nAnd from the new king's mouth gushed blackened, dirtied, and bloodied lies, which gradually stained his hero's reputation a deep black...\nAnd so, the second prophecy was fulfilled.\n\nLater, Shiruyeh, the son of Kisra Parvezravan, grew to adulthood beloved by his mother, but was banished by his father from the towering city of Gurabad. Made by his father to hide his face and flee on a fast steed, Shiruyeh was henceforth forbidden from setting foot in the city again. Undoubtedly terrified of the fairy-mother Liloufar's warning, it was Parvezravan's fixation that gave rise to the cowardice that spurred this decision.\nAnd so, Shirin once again found the perfect opportunity for revenge in the vassal king's unfettered fear.\n\nOne night, she disguised herself as a divine princess of the temple to the moon goddess and met with her prodigal son who had sojourned there. In the lingering silvery light that danced amidst the dew-dotted lilies, she gave the masked wayfarer this false, illusory prophecy:\n\"Is the tyranny of the wanderer's father not his greatest misfortune? O darling of the moon goddess, everywhere the moonlight touches is yours to rule, and every seed you sow shall grow and flourish. Since the moonlight has granted you a good bow and a sharp blade, why do you suffer that coward idling upon the throne? Why not muster up the courage to face your hatred, to face yourself?\"\nLegend has it that just as Shiruyeh hesitated in indecision, a gust of wind rushed through the night and blew the veil Shirin had used to conceal her face away.\nSeeing that familiar face, the young man who had been forced to cover his was instantly overcome with terror and shame. He fled the sullied temple in a panic, and laughter soft as the ringing of a bell and the cruel moonlight bore witness to his fear.\n\nThe story from here is a lackluster one: The peerless vassal king \"Parvezravan\" would be stabbed to death in his bed by his own masked, unfilial son, and his magnificent bed — once adorned with sapphire and golden animal horns — would be indelibly stained with his blood.\nThe dirge of the spirits then goes like this: After committing this crime of treason, Shiruyeh wept bitterly before his mother Shirin in repentance. But Shirin did not reprimand him. Rather she took her beloved son into her arms, removed the brass mask symbolizing his exile, and left him with an affectionate kiss of benediction.\n\nAfter Shiruyeh claimed the throne, he was long tormented by inescapable nightmares until finally, on a frenzied night of wandering, he fell into a deep black chasm in the earth and disappeared. Later, a great plague emerged from that chasm and swallowed up half of the souls in the city of Gurabad. The kingdom, having lost its vassal king and his servants, fell into ruin and was gradually devoured by that insatiable yellow sand.\nThe scattered survivors of this calamity called it \"Shiruyeh's Plague\" — the divine retribution invited by the absurdly short-lived despot himself.\n\nAs for his mother Shirin, Liloufar's third prophecy was indeed fulfilled — She and the heir she bore won true freedom in a kingdom ravaged by vengeance, and they became evil apparitions, death knells to the conceited.\n\n\"Some people say that Shirin was later subdued by my lord Al-Ahmar, who detained her in a magic silver bottle. Others say that she still roams the desert, tormenting overconfident adventurers and tirelessly searching for the beloved child that she lost to that dark world...\"\nThe fairy smiled proudly, having theatrically concluded the story.\nAt this time, the moon was already high in the sky, and the distant, ancient time when the desert had not yet become a desert was nigh. It was time for the divine princess to hold the sacrifice.\n"},{"id":"Book429","title":"Book429","filename":"Book429_EN.txt","text":"According to the desert dwellers, the world was once ruled by a king named Al-Ahmar, a king of warriors, horticulturists, and sages. He controlled the winds whistling through the desert, the dunes turned bright silver by moonlight, and the one thousand and one Jinn who hid within the night and the calls of owls.\n\nThey say that Al-Ahmar was a son of the sky. That is why he was known as the king of the world and received the fervent faith of countless people from the three great tribes, and was even adored by the elusive Jinn. Whenever he looked up to the sky and recalled the boundless paradise high above, and the merciless reign of thousands of years past, Al-Ahmar could not help but lower his noble head and sigh helplessly.\nIn such moments, even the songs of the nightingale and the aroma of roses could not pull him from his sorrow.\n\nThe desert dwellers knew well that the ravings of nostalgia often presaged the arrival of calamity. But in that world where the wise enjoyed peace and happiness, and in the era where brave young men and women courted like lions and roses, no one foresaw the arrival of catastrophe.\nBut how should we blame the people and spirits of the past? Even one as wise as the greatest of sages, Hermanubis, could never have known that the valiant tribe that once could equal the dragons would be reduced to corpse-eating monsters a thousand years later, and that their sullied honor and bones would be buried for eternity beneath the gilded dunes. How could he have known that the tribe of the wise, known for generations of sages, would lose our texts and become wandering bards of the desert, mourning our emperor with songs that only the Jinn understand?\nIt is as the sages say: a mere thought can yet often bring forth calamity, if it is from the undisguised melancholy and madness of a king.\n\nThus did the three retainers of Al-Ahmar (may seven times seven curses fall upon them!) present their strategy to the king:\n\n\"Your Majesty, ruler of the world, lord of the four corners of the earth, king over Jinn and mortals alike.\"\nThe Goat King, the minister of all ministers, spoke flatteringly,\n\"I humbly beg your pardon if I overstep, but Your Majesty, I'm certain you are aware that indulging in dreams of old and sorrows of the past is no way to be for long. The endless power and wisdom of this land can build you a palace that surpasses the heavens, Your Majesty, and it shall bring your people a prosperous future.\"\n\n\"No,\" Al-Ahmar said with a frown, and the Goat King fell silent.\n\n\"Your Majesty, son of the sky, subjugator of gods, and greatest of all sages,\"\nThe Ibis King, the scribe of all scribes, advised,\n\"The divine punishment of a thousand years past brought the downfall of wisdom and history. For a better future, Your Majesty, you should take control of the past. The present oases hold the wisdom of the 'present', but if we are to seize the 'past', we must act swiftly.\"\n\n\"No.\" Al-Ahmar struck the ground with his staff, and the Ibis King fell silent.\n\n\"Your Majesty, lord of dunes and oases, guide of the living and the dead, master of all elements.\"\nThe Crocodile King, the commander of commanders, spoke frankly,\n\"If we are to recall the lost lives and welcome lost opportunities and dreams back into the fold, then this is our final chance. The greater the authority, the greater the emptiness. The greater the wisdom, the greater the sorrow. Forget the delusions of the Void. Only resurrection and life eternal can fill the endless pit of regret.\"\n\nAl-Ahmar fell silent.\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nThe arbitrary king heeded his retainers' lies. Thus did Al-Ahmar use a hundred years and a hundred years further to build a huge maze for his kingdom, before trapping himself deep within it in search of forbidden knowledge and an elixir with which he might abandon his mortal form.\n\nThe subsequent events are knowledge that should not be revisited. They should be eternally forgotten by any rational history.\n\nAccording to the legends of the desert dwellers, in just one night, the kingdom of wisdom and power was buried by the sands of retribution.\nThey say Al-Ahmar separated his mind from his flesh and bone, placing it within the corridors, stairways, doorways, and beams that crawled eternally into the depths.\nIt is said that Al-Ahmar's body gradually decayed on his throne while worms feasted on it, and that his soul merged into one with the wailing souls of the millions in his kingdom, doomed to wander, lost amidst the howling end, traveling along the dark and winding corridors, growing ever closer to the bottomless abyss...\n\nThus did the minds of millions merge into one, a lone soul that would eventually succumb to madness.\nAnd so, Al-Ahmar's kingdom was built and destroyed by his own hand.\n\nThey say that when that night came, the desert quaked, and the walls of Al-Ahmar's royal city collapsed. One thousand and one pillars trembled before the gale, and the bulls and griffins that once stood proudly atop them, gazing down at the lifeless dunes, now reluctantly fell into its gilded embrace. Countless people, sage or fool, hero or coward — all of them vanished within the sandstorm that night.\nThe lucky survivors fell into eternal silence. It's said that they were made blind and mute as punishment for their sin of benefitting from forbidden knowledge.\nThe sages say that trying to keep knowledge for yourself is ignorance, and that the punishment for ignorance is ignorance itself.\n\nAs for the descendants of the ignorant who have lost their history, the Eremites say:\n\nWe have returned from the land of the lost,\nThe sky of the ages we have changed,\nFear shall not stop us,\nNo god shall we heed.\nAcross the ocean of sand akin to gravel,\nTo its end we shall sail.\n"},{"id":"Book42","title":"Book42","filename":"Book42_EN.txt","text":"Explosion inside city walls, grounded be thy woe\nExplosions can hurt people, Jean can be dreadful\nMondstadt be bombed, Klee be doomed"},{"id":"Book430","title":"Book430","filename":"Book430_EN.txt","text":"...I don't dare presume to mention her true name, let alone overstep my bounds as an earthly being to judge her divinity.

Of those she created, none could escape their destined annihilation. The goodness, peace, and wisdom she had bestowed — all perished before this pure malice without exception. Under that sneering waning moon, the black tide of decay surged over the deserts and through the valleys, turning clear springs once interlaced with roses into puddles of filth, defiling the earth as mortals trembled with despair. The sages called it The Black Tide, for it was a dark flood that swallowed up fields, villages, and cities.\n\nShe witnessed this all with her own eyes and wept bitterly for the sorrow and suffering of the living.

The primary form of Aaru is nearing completion.\nIt won't be long before Aaru becomes capable of encompassing the desert in its entirety, just as Lord Al-Ahmar had prophesied.\nThis way, Lord Al-Ahmar's unbending ambition will finally be realized.\n\nWhen that day comes, I will be able to see my mother's smile again.\nMy mother was always prejudiced against Lord Al-Ahmar. She was of the opinion that he was the cause of the calamity in Gurabad. But this was not the case.\nShe seemed to have forgotten that it was Lord Al-Ahmar who promoted me, the product of a tryst between a fugitive and a maid, to be the architect of Aaru.\nTo a person with a background such as mine, this was an exceptional honor.\n\nNo king loves his people more than Lord Al-Ahmar does.\nIt was precisely because he was saddened by the disaster that took my father's life that he made the decision to build Aaru in order to prevent such a thing from happening again.\nI firmly believe this.\n\nThe mortal plane is like a river between the underworld and Aaru. Mortals must not cross, must not probe, must not covet, or they shall descend into the underworld forever.\nIn order to ascend to Aaru, one must have a body like that of a vulture and soar above the underworld. One should peck at three different organs in order to obtain the consent of Al-Ahmar, and fly across the river in the form of a falcon.\nAfter flying across the river in falcon form, one must burn the embers of the sun at three places using feathers. Only through this may one obtain the mercy of Al-Ahmar and ascend to Aaru.\n\nHere's to hoping that wisdom lives on in Khaj-Nisut, that all descendants of the desert will ascend to Aaru, and that Gurabad will be restored to its former glory.\nI hope that all this will leave an everlasting legacy.\n\nWait.

During this month, we have recorded everything that could be discovered outside the Mausoleum of King Deshret.\nBut what's the use of that? Any potential topic has already been written about.\nWhen I saw that people were writing extremely niche and incomprehensible papers like \"The Aesthetic Preferences of Structures in Deshret's Civilization: An Analysis Using the Pyramidal Inclination of the Mausoleum of King Deshret as an Example,\" I knew that the only way to find a breakthrough would be to enter the Mausoleum itself.\nBut we couldn't enter the Mausoleum. Everyone's patience has been worn out, not to mention we're running out of drinkable water.\nI'll give it another day. Hopefully, during our last attempt, things will go according to what the legends say: Spring water will burst forth from the long-dried well, and the unyielding barrier will finally be shattered.\n\nDay 34\nI'm returning to Aaru Village.\n\nDay 35\nI can't just leave empty-handed... I have to think of something, or else I'd become a laughing stock...\n\nDay 38\nWe discovered new ruins. But whenever we try getting closer, a transparent mechanism would push us away, stopping us from proceeding further.\nI am absolutely certain that Deshret created this mechanism to cover up evidence of his tyrannical autocracy.\n\nDay 42\nWe discovered three more of these transparent ruins, which makes them four in total. However, we still haven't found a way to enter any of them. Going to record their locations for now.\nIt feels like some kind of illusion. Perhaps a Vision is necessary for cracking the case... I need to look into that.\n\nDay 45\nWe have arrived at The Dune of Carouses. The cone-shaped ruins that look just like a smaller version of the Mausoleum of King Deshret are located here. I guess I'll call it the Tomb of Carouses for now. Though it's a lot smaller than the Mausoleum of King Deshret, I still find it hard to imagine how Deshret enslaved his people to build such a structure.\nDisappointingly, we've encountered the same mysterious power as last time, keeping us from entering.\n\nI will not waste any more time. We'll head further into the desert tomorrow and see if we can find the fabled oasis.\n\n\nDay 46\nThe archaeology team has been attacked by a group of Eremites. They call themselves \"Thutmose.\" I've never heard of that name before.\nTheir leaders were two young men. One wanted to kill us all, but surprisingly, the other young man stopped him and let us all go.\n\nThey seemed like fanatic believers in Deshret, so they're nowhere near decent. Nevertheless, I hope Deshret will always bless that young man, and that his axe will always remain sharp.\nI have no choice but to return to the Akademiya and face their ridicule now... But to be honest, compared to the mockery, having no improvement in knowledge is more painful to endure.\nIn the boundless forest of knowledge, I am but a snail that has only just crawled onto one of the branches... \n\nI've also been thinking... The sheep in a nearby area often disappear for no reason. The locals believed that they were swallowed up by the rock formations, so they named the place \"Lamb-Devourer Rock.\"\nThose Eremites suddenly jumped out from the rocks, then disappeared into them. If we draw a parallel between them and the disappearing sheep, the answer becomes very straightforward...\nThe Thutmose members might be using a specialized technique to hide themselves, or perhaps there's a hidden cave somewhere. Anyway, I'm going to write down the location first.\nIf I ever return to this place, I'll hire an Eremite from Thutmose as my guide.\n\n..."},{"id":"Book43","title":"Book43","filename":"Book43_EN.txt","text":"\"...I've been thinking this over for a long time, and feel I should tell him the truth.

Body elemental quantities were at abnormally high levels, and were positively correlated with the severity of the disease.

It is reasonable to hypothesize that there is a causal relationship between elemental quantities and \"Eleazar.\" More controlled trials should be conducted to exclude redundant variables.\n...\nNote: The enrichment process of elemental quantities in humans may be dynamically sustained.\nAfter the completion of early ███ experiments, within a short period of time, Specimen I's physical indicators trended to the norm. In later stages, due to ███ not being complete, the quantity of elements in the sample bodies rebounded, and symptoms increased, leading to Specimen I ████████. Could not be recycled for materials.\nInformation obtained: Preparations must be made for long-term trials. ███ cannot be stopped before the specimens' symptoms have stabilized. Due to the nature of the trial, there must be a method to stabilize the sample's moods. Removal of ███ may be attempted.\n...\nFollowing the new method, the material rejection rate has been significantly reduced. Specimens II and III developed mental instability due to associative connections to fundamental inner qualities of ███, and tended to attribute the disease to unverifiable \"divine punishment,\" consequently considering it \"blasphemy\" to accept ███ as treatment. It is a very interesting thought. Exploring neurostimulation and the resulting cognitive shifts could be a future research topic.\nDue to the above uncontrollable variables, they halted at Stage 2. A shame. However, the materials provided by these two samples were the best quality materials so far. It is reasonable to believe that the perfect performance of Specimen IV is related to the material quality provided by these two samples. Ultimately, once the three-stage experiment was completed, Specimen IV's symptoms disappeared completely, proving that:\nIt is possible to use ███ to control the elemental content of a person's body without relying on elemental power. There is potential for weaponization.\nDiscussions of research on ███ have to be increased in the future. Humans have unlimited potential.

Fragrant flowers bloomed and proliferated again in this dead domain and remain as abundant today as the gravel in the Ardravi River. Even hurricanes abated into gentle exhalations before her singing, causing the bells on her lapels to sway as they rang out elegantly. All the spirits, their envoys, humans, and the inhuman rejoiced and praised her name, for she is indeed the most sagacious and the most merciful.\n\nIn the depths of the forest, she collected grass to use as an instrument, picked flowers for a crown, and played a flawless tune with a Karrenay. In an instant, thousands of demonic troops were reduced to dust and scattered to the four winds, never to be found again. She gently brushed away the tears of the forest creatures and soothed their anguish, just as she once blew the wind of life across the barren sea of sand, like the emissary of an eternal oasis from time immemorial.\n\nBut this land remained broken, its heart devoured by evil spirits and monsters who made it their dwelling — a cavern of the damned where neither sun, moon, nor fire shine. The dust they took for treasure and the sludge served as their delicacies, like birds clad in feathers but unable to soar in the skies. So she made a great wish, vowing that she would go into those cankered, rotted courts, setting forth on her sojourn to cleanse the withered land.\n\nAll the spirits, their envoys, humans, and the inhuman all watched as she entered the hollowed heart of the mortal world and touched its timeless face.

This was the moment when the pure lotuses would bloom. A flourishing sea of flowers rolled all about her, and like jade it appeared, rosy in fragrance and dewy as heavenly raiment. The songs of a hundred birds surrounded her, praising the youth that she had reclaimed. The years lost by the children of humanity were nowhere to be found again, like the wind that flows through the forest, but she returned in spite of all things, showing her incandescent divinity to the world once more, just as she had in the beginning when she sowed the first seeds into the desert sands.

The shadowless folk were shocked to find that the adventurer had a lockstep attendant, silent and loyal. The adventurer, too, was shocked to see that people lived in the world who would not cast a shadow because of the sunlight.\n\"Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would make such a discovery,\" said the adventurer.\n\"Dreams? We have not had those in a long time,\" said one of the shadowless people. \"Our elders tell us that all dreams have already been dreamed.\"\n\"Shadows hide the secrets of the soul. You have no shadows, and that is why you do not dream,\" said the adventurer. \"Perhaps you did once have shadows, just like you once did dream.\"\n\"If that is so, where shall I go to find that which I have lost?\"\n\"Go to the secret forest. Many dreams dwell there, and perhaps those who capture dreams there may have some extras to share with you.\"\nAnd so, the young shadowless person left his homeland behind, traveling far off to visit the secret forest the adventurer had spoken of. This forest was filled with layers of shadows: the shadows of the clouds, tree canopies... Even the tiny birds cast large shadows over the soft soil.\nDay after day, he passed between the crisscrossed shadows. Shadows hide the soul's secrets, he thought, and perhaps he was the only one here without any secrets. And so, one day, he discovered that all dreamscapes were open to him, for he had no dreams, but it was because of this that he could enter the dreams of others.\nIn the many dreams he witnessed, the birds dreamed of vivid colors, the tiger of fragrant scents, but he did not see those who capture dreams, nor did he discover the excess dreams that were spoken of. The dreams, the shadows, and the beings that dwelt here could be matched one for one... and so he wondered if the adventurer had cheated him, and if there really was no such thing as a masterless dream, just as there was no such thing as a shadow without a source.\nBut just as he was about to admit defeat, the one who captures dreams found him. Their encounter happened within the dream of a seashell. He barged into its ending, searching for the white waves and the salty wind, but neither was to be found in its saddened aftertaste.\n\"Just like this shell, you do not belong to this forest.\"\nThe speaker was a woman, and he quickly realized that she was the dream-captor spoken the adventurer spoke of, for her shadow had a strange, mottled texture, like drapery encrusted with gems.\n\"I have been looking for you,\" he said. \"Perhaps you have some extra dreams...\"\n\"They pass like the morning dew...\" She said, and there was no sadness in her voice. \"Masterless dreams cannot last long. I have tried many times, but they always dissipate in the end.\"\n\"...See, just like this seashell... We must both leave.\" Taking his hand, she led him from this fading dream bereft of white waves and salty winds.\nBeside a murmuring brook, she told him a great many stories, and taught him how to enter dreams. After that, she warned him multiple times concerning the taboos of the dream-captors, such as how they should never gaze repeatedly into another's dream, for their secrets are like a bottomless well.\n\"The nightmares are more cunning than you can imagine. Once they discover what you have done, they will arise like a swarm and drag you into the darkness. You will not be able to leave that place, the boundary where no shadows are. If you wait long enough, you will be able to make out meaningful words, names that linger in faded memories that no longer belong anywhere. And you know that you must not speak the names of the dead, or they will seek you out...\"\n\"I once believed that none of you had shadows,\" he said honestly. \"I once believed that dream-captors did not have their own dreams, which is why they collected those that belong to others.\"\nThe woman did not reply, her mottled shadow swaying in the night wind like a leaf.\nBut the young shadowless man was too eager for the answer, and though the dream-captor defended the shadows well, he found his chance nonetheless. Unlike the dreams of the forest beings, whose dream-gates were wide open, it was a rugged path that led to the dream-captor's dreamscape.\nIt seemed evident to him that she had hidden her secrets in others' dreams, he thought, but what were her secrets? And whose dreams were these?\nThe dream-captor's dream was many-layered, just like the secret forest, and so he lost his way, and before he knew it, the nightmares were upon him.\n\"I have broken the dream-captor's taboo, but even if I can see that bottomless well, I cannot find my answer,\" he thought. \"She said that if I stayed long enough, I might able to make out a name from their voices. At least that way, I will know whose dream this is.\"\nAnd so he allowed himself to be led into the depths, and just as the woman had warned him, it was a boundless, lightless realm. He listened then for the tiny sounds, hoping to find words that could point to a name.\nAn unknown period of time passed before he finally heard a name amidst the scattered sounds. This sound had a strange, special attraction to him, and he could not help but recite it.\nThen he opened his eyes.\n\"I saw a strange sight,\" he said. \"I saw that a woman had entered my dreams and stolen them, stolen secrets of my soul that I didn't know existed, and since that day, I no longer had a shadow. And I heard her say this, and she called me...\"\n\"You know,\" she said, interrupting him, \"that one should not speak the names of the dead, or they will seek you out...\"\nThe dream-captor sat by the murmuring brook, her mottled shadow swaying in the night wind like a leaf.\n\"That is but a tale about the dead. I have told you such tales before, but there are many more that have yet to be told.\"\nAnd so the dream-captor continued to tell the young man with no shadow a story that none have yet heard..."},{"id":"Book464","title":"Book464","filename":"Book464_EN.txt","text":"The Tale of the Dastur\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a Vahumana Dastur who traveled alone into the desert depths to investigate the ruins of ancient realms. Unfortunately, he encountered a sandstorm and lost his way. But just as he was about to breathe his last, a young woman with amber eyes appeared before him. She parted the howling sands with the staff in her hand, and led him out of the desert.\n\nIt was already noon by the time they reached the village. She treated him to lunch at her home and offered to escort him back to Caravan Ribat. But, having seen her part the sands as if by some spell, and how she had chased the dark beasts along their path away, the Dastur refused to leave, instead asking if she could teach him the secret arts of ancient lands.\n\nThe mage replied that her amber eyes could see all that the living and the dead had seen. People without shadows, a bronze clock whose pendulum swings by the power of imagination, whales that have never left land, a city that only exists by the reflected moonlight upon a silver mirror, a scholar imprisoned within eternity, a high tower hanging upon seven strings. She could see that he had infinite potential and a boundless future ahead of him, and she was indeed willing to teach him all she knew. She had but one worry — that after learning all, he would seek his own profit and come to deny her.\n\nThe Dastur knelt to the ground and kissed the tip of her shoes, promising that he would never forget what she had done for him no matter what, and that he would never deny her, even if they should then die together. His earnestness touched the young mage, and smiling gently, she helped him up. Holding his hand, she brought him to the door to her basement, saying that she would indeed take him as her disciple, and that all her secrets were hidden in her underground library.\n\nAnd so they walked down the winding stairs, level after level, with a mirror hung on the wall of each level, reflecting their faces and the feeble light of lit sconces. They walked for who knows how long — perhaps several hours, perhaps several minutes — for the darkness had obscured their sense of time. At the end of the stairs was a narrow gate, and behind the gate was a hexagonal library. He could not see the ceiling, nor could he estimate the height of this room, but the books in here nonetheless far surpassed all he imagined was possible for knowledge.\n\nHe learned well under her tutelage, but after a few weeks, envoys from the Temple of Silence would come to the Dastur and tell him that his mentor had passed on due to illness and that owing to his thesis passing review, the Akademiya had decided to make an exception for him and promote him to Herbad, that he might take over from his mentor and continue to educate more students. The newly-appointed Herbad was greatly pleased, and yet he was unwilling to leave yet, and so he carefully asked the mage if she could bring some of her books and come with him to the Akademiya, and there continue to teach him. She agreed to his invitation, but said that she had a sister who had always longed to learn at the Akademiya but was ultimately not accepted due to her desert heritage. She thus asked if the Herbad could take her own as an auditing pupil. The Herbad replied that the Akademiya had a strict testing process and that he could not make exceptions, not even to take someone on as an auditing pupil. The mage for her part said nothing more, simply packing her bags and following him to Sumeru.\n\nSeveral years later, the sage of Vahumana passed on. Thanks to the earth-shaking theses he had been able to write and complete with the aid of the mage, it was unsurprising that the Herbad was recommended to become the new sage. The mage went to congratulate him, and asked if he might take her sister on as an auditing student now that he had his position as a sage. The newly-appointed sage rejected her, saying that he had no duty to do this, for he no longer needed her guidance, being someone who no longer needed to write theses. He advised her to return to her village and live out the rest of her days in peace. The mage said nothing more, and packing her bags, she returned to the desert.\n\nSeveral years later, the Grand Sage too passed, and the Vahumana sage was selected to take the post. Hearing this news, the mage came hurriedly from the desert. Finding him, she knelt at his feet and kissed the tip of his shoe, reminding him of the promise he had made her and begging him to take those of her tribe who had been displaced by the sandstorms in and allow them to have refuge beneath the rainforest bower. The Grand Sage was furious and threatened to hurl her into a jail of bronze and leave her to die of starvation and thirst, for he did not know this charlatan of the desert wastes, and who was she, anyway, to coerce the Akademiya? The mage, no longer young, lifted her head, wiping the tears from her cheeks, and looked upon the Grand Sage one last time with her turbid amber eyes. She begged that she might be allowed to return to her village and help her tribespeople. Refusing, the Grand Sage had his soldiers bind her. And so the mage said little more to him save only this:\n\n\"In that case, I must ask you, sir, to return to your own village.\"\n\nThe Grand Sage was startled, and when he had lifted his head, he found himself standing before Caravan Ribat. The night had grown long, and the distant village could no longer be seen clearly, shrouded as it now was in flying dust and sand and night's own cloak. The young woman stood before him, smiling, and her amber eyes reflected how he appeared at this moment: the Dastur of Vahumana, whose thesis had yet to pass review.\n\n\"Well then, the hour is late, and you should return to the Akademiya now.

Yet the mariner's life had left him time for but a single son in his latter years, and passed away before the prince would reach adulthood.\nThe Dey's son had inherited his great wealth, but had no power over those his father had administered. Guided by elders who lacked moral fiber, he quickly began to live the life of a sensuous animal. The prosperous streets of Port Ormos were like a beast that swallowed gold, and so the Dey's inheritance was emptied by the princeling within a few years, even saddling him with a massive debt in the process. By the time the prince came to his senses, the walls of his home were bare, with not a single Mora to be found within. After selling his estates and dismissing the servants, the prince, with nowhere to go, sought refuge at a shrine to an ancient patron god of mariners, which through the patronage of his father in turn had attained its current august stature.\nThe prince asked the shrine's priest for aid thusly: \"Wise elder, I was once the son of a Dey who conquered the seven seas, but see, I have fallen this far due to my unconstrained extravagance. I beg that you have mercy upon me and show me a swift way through which I might clear my debts and ransom my estates. I promise that I will change for the better and become a man who knows his place.\"\n\"Young prince,\" the priest said, \"the fates of mortals have long been ordained by the gods, but they must accomplish those fates themselves. Since you desire to turn over a new leaf, should you not begin through hard work rather than relying on opportunism?\"\nThe prince quickly replied, \"my father was a great patron of this shrine, so if we must argue, half of the golden statues and indeed, your expenses, should belong to me by right. And am I not here to claim this debt I am owed?\"\n\"Arrogant prince, will you make an enemy of the gods?\" The priest said with a sigh. \"Yet on your father's account, if you shall promise to keep to your place and manage your finances well, I shall tell you how to become wealthy.\"\nAnd so the prince swore to upon the divine statue, and the priest directed him to a street market at the outport. Coming to said market, the prince met a woman dressed in great finery tending to an emaciated Sumpter Beast.\n\"Esteemed lady,\" the prince asked, \"is there anything I might do for you?\"\n\"You've come at a good time,\" the woman replied. \"I must go out to sea on an urgent errand, and I fear that there is no one who can help me take care of this beast. But if you will aid me, I shall return in three months and pay you ten million Mora.\"\nThe prince was overjoyed at this.\n\"But,\" the woman continued, \"you must not feed this beast till it is full, nor can you speak to it. Otherwise, even that which you own now, you shall lose.\"\n\"And what have I to lose?\" The prince thought to himself, and thus agreed readily. The woman then entrusted the Sumpter Beast to him. Three months passed quickly, and as the woman requested, not once did he completely fill the Sumpter Beast's stomach, nor did he speak one word to it, until the final day.\nOn this day, the prince, excited at the thought of his soon-to-be reward as he sat before a fire, spoke to the Sumpter Beast, \"O good Sumpter Beast, it is thanks to you that I shall be rich again. If you have a request, name it, and I shall satisfy you.\"\nHearing these words, the Sumpter Beast cried, \"O honored prince, I have no other wish but to have a full stomach on this last day.\"\nHearing the Sumpter Beast speak, the prince was greatly shocked and allowed his curiosity to take over, forgetting all about the woman's instruction. Turning around, he brought water and hay from the feeding trough.\n\"My most gentle prince,\" the now-full Sumpter Beast said slowly, \"I was once a god who served the heavens and ruled over many vassal kings of the desert, but I was cheated by that venomous witch and forced into this form. If you will have mercy upon me and release me into the desert, I swear upon the king of the blazing sun that I will grant you riches beyond counting, more by far than what that witch can give.\"\nThe prince felt dubious about the Sumpter Beast's words, and so he decided to hide it, and then conceal himself in a corner to await the woman's return.\nShe did indeed return the next day, only to find both prince and Sumpter Beast missing.\n\"Faithless wretch!\" The woman cursed. \"If I catch you, I shall seal you in the smallest magic bottle I find, and there you shall face eternal torment!\"\nSeeing her thus, the prince finally believed the Sumpter Beast's words. Once she had left, he prepared to release the poor animal. As it was about to leave, it said to him, \"O merciful prince, may all the desert gods defend you — I shall fulfill my promise to grant you endless riches and happiness. I ask only that you do not ask where they came from, or else, you will lose even that which you have now.\"\nFollowing the Sumpter Beast's directions, the prince came to a hidden place at the edge of the desert, and there he did indeed discover a mighty and luxurious palace. Its walls were decorated with gold and gems, and its gates were made of pure gold, with a lovely male servant leading many lovely ladies out of those great doors to receive him.\nAnd thus did the prince once again lead an opulent life. Each day, the male servant would bring him silver, gold, pearls, and gems. Rare delicacies and fine wine were his to enjoy, and each day brought unique dancing girls to keep him company — and such was his life for three years.\nBut even in merriment and revelry could boredom be bred, and one day the prince woke from days of drunken stupor, and he thought to himself, \"I tired now of my life today, and am in need of new thrills. Now, was it not because I refused the instruction of the witch that I gained this life of mine? Who then may say if that Sumpter Beast did not hide something from me for fear that I might discover his secret? If I can find the source of this limitless wealth, surely greater happiness still shall be mine.\"\nAnd so the prince summoned his faithful servant, and said to him, \"my most loyal servant. Could you tell me of the source of the gold and gems, wine and spirits, and even these musicians and courtesans, that you bring before me each day?\"\n\"Of course, my respected master,\" the manservant replied. \"Each day, I traverse the lands between the desert and this place, and all that you enjoy is drawn thereof. Your lovely dancers were once swaying desert eels, the glittering gold are the endless sands, and the gourmet meals you enjoy are of my own personal make.\"\n\"And I, your loyal servant,\" the manservant paused, \"am naught but a humble scarab.\"\nJust as he finished speaking, the glorious palace dissolved in an instant, and the prince found that he was seated upon a squat sand dune, and there was nothing around him apart from crawling insects.\nAfter a long while, he regained his senses, and even through his shock and terror he felt the hand of grief and regret. And yet, what he had now lost could not easily be regained, and the prince was at last reduced to wandering, never to feel happiness again. From then on, he would tell anyone who wished to hear him speak this story..."},{"id":"Book466","title":"Book466","filename":"Book466_EN.txt","text":"The Tale of the Researcher\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a researcher, upon whom all the hallmarks of the haughty man of letters might be seen, though he himself — and we shall be generous to him here — was not the best amongst his peers.\nKnowledge is like a fruit, after all, and time quickly whittles its freshness away. If he cannot eat it all while it is still juicy and full, the rest shall taste like sweet decay.\n\"Time,\" the young researcher said, \"you truly are my hated foe — even more so than I consider my colleagues.\"\nAlas, innate characteristics such as laziness cannot be so easily shaken off. Thus did winters turn to summers and back again, bringing his \"hated colleagues\" glory and praise, while he was left with the scars of the bygone years.\nPerhaps this was some trick of fate, but our main character would indeed discover a way to make his wish reality — quite by accident, in fact.\n\"Time seems fair, though it is but a veneer. That I am not as quick-witted as others is not due to a lack of talent. Nay, 'tis but the cruelty of time...\" So thought the researcher, now no longer young. \"Now that my chance has come, I must use it well.\"\nAnd so he made this wish to the injured Jinni: \"I wish for time to be just... so that I might write better theses.\"\nThe Jinni understood him quite easily, saying: \"All things come with a price.\"\n\"Well, yes, and I have clearly paid part of that toll,\" he said, shrugging. \"I have wasted my youth on pointless pursuits. Now that things have come to this point, I no longer desire common joys. I only wish to leave behind a work of stunning brilliance, that my name will be praised for generations. Nor do I wish for my work to be left on perishable ink and paper, but it shall instead be carved into stone. Thousands of years on, my marks shall still be left upon this world... and this way, I shall have my justice — I shall triumph over time.\"\n\"If that is your will,\" the Jinni replied noncommittally, fulfilling the researcher's wish nonetheless.\nBut whether that was truly a Jinni or some demon in disguise was quite the matter of contention, especially in hindsight. Leaving this matter aside, the researcher whose wish was fulfilled found that everything had now become slow compared to his thinking.\n\"Good, good. Now then, my agility of mind shall not be a problem.\" At first, the researcher was most pleased. Now that he had ample slack, so to speak, there was much time for thoughtful consideration. The time it took for a sand grain to fall to the earth was not sufficient for him to raise his left hand to touch his forehead, but his mind could sprint during this time — from forest to desert, from vast plain to snowy tundra it could run indeed. He cursed that all the pages of a book could not be laid out flat, but had to be flipped one by one. But even had they been laid out before him, his eyeballs would have failed to move quickly enough. By the time his eyes had finished resting upon a single word, he would already have exhausted all vocabulary related to that word, and all imagination pertaining to that vocabulary.\n\"I think too much and write too little,\" the researcher thought afterward. \"I must use the most elegant words to write the most academically rigorous paper.\" But when he had penned the first word, his thoughts had already leaped to the conclusion. And so he had to constantly repeat the essay to himself, and as he silently dictated the text, it would become more and more refined. Yet, this could only happen in his mind — when all was said and done, his right hand had yet to even write seven words.\nAnd thus was this great work, comprised of the finest lexicon and the stoutest logic, compromised by the researcher's own body. Every passage came out tattered, as if someone had shredded every page and put them back together haphazardly. The words that were connected felt like fragments randomly selected from a complete text, and no one could really grasp the connection between them.\nIt was on a starless night when he, with all his strength, like one completing a centuries-long exodus, managed to leave his study, arriving at the courtyard downstairs.\n\"Perhaps speaking shall be more direct than writing,\" he said, a single bare thread of hope remaining in his heart. But his very voice seemed to stumble after the weave of his thoughts. His syllables came out disjointed and fragmentary — as if the intent behind the words had changed even as they were being said, and so they came out as mere mumbling and whimpering.\n\"Alas, poor old fellow! One might almost think he has been possessed!\" So said the well-dressed young folk who looked upon him with sympathy. \"But at least he still has the moon.\"\nThey left after saying these words, leaving the researcher alone in the moon-bathed courtyard, trapped in the prison he once called a body. Then the mere husk of a mortal man began to recall a story that he had once read..."},{"id":"Book467","title":"Book467","filename":"Book467_EN.txt","text":"The Tale of the Mirror, the Palace, and the Dreamer\n\nNight after night, she would always dream about that distant palace. Its intricate structure was formed of infinite corners, arcades, and passages, and at each corner would be hung a silver mirror with a gilded frame. It was said that the king spent 200 years (6 years more must be added if one wishes to follow the numbering of years in those days) to design this place, and when seated upon the throne, he could gaze into any mirror, and through its exquisitely planned and winding paths of light, one could glimpse any corner of his realm. Yet when she looked into the mirrors at the ends of the hallways in her dream, all she could see was a blurry image: that of a masked young woman garbed in fine raiment, wearing lovely ornaments, walking through the opulent corridors, like a heat haze in the flaming gold of day. She knew then her purpose, though it might seem strange — she wished to gain an audience with that king and tell him something, for these words had been put into her heart and were not hers to command, though she would always leave those words somewhere in the warping mirror-lights each time she awoke with a start.\nYear after year, in her dreams as clear as dawn, she would try — and fail — to find the way to the throne, nor would she ever witness that king in person. The young lady who was once lost amongst the mirrors was now a famed magician, and even so, in those stolen dreaming moments, in those flashes of unconscious lucidity, those fantastical thoughts still had her soul in their iron grip. One day, the great mage discovered clues to reaching that distant kingdom at last. Forsaking all that the worldly might hold dear, she set out on her journey alone. Across mottled moonlight she sailed, through the shadowed valleys she strode, and the darkest forests she braved, until she, at last, reached that realm of her dreams. But alas, alas! That city had been annihilated in a terrible fire a few hundred years ago, and the once-prosperous kingdom was now no more. It is just as the poets say:\n\nThe morning breeze is forgotten by all,\nSong and color have faded from sight.\nOnly the dim gleam of towers tall,\nLights the ruined, barren night.\n\nShe entered the devastated palace and walked amidst its ruins. The mirrors and their gilded frames had long been shattered, with naught but their shattered wrack remaining, each splinter reflecting a beam of chilling moonlight. The court was not as bizarre or strange as it had been in her dreams — in a few mere corners and a few corridors, she was knocking on the door of the throne room. It was a circular hall with hundreds of mirrors hanging from the stone walls — though like the mirrors in the hallways, these had also mostly been destroyed. The mage subconsciously walked towards that long-vacated throne and sat down, casting her gaze upon one of the still-whole mirrors.\nIn that mirror, she beheld again that masked young woman garbed in fine raiment, walking amidst the opulent halls, and behind her, the mirrors — mirrors that had never been shattered — reflected a thousand reflections of her form.\nShe startled and raised her head, for that young woman now stood before her, silently watching, unimaginable pain in her eyes. The mage had only just thought of something to say when the woman drew a dagger — before stabbing her in the heart. A lustrous rose-bloom graced the silent tip of the blade as flames ignited all around them, consuming the hall that had once been destroyed by a great blaze once more.\nShe smiled in confusion, astonishment, and relief, for the woman then took her mask off, revealing the features of the mage herself, dry lips quivering ever so slightly.\nThis time, the mage could finally hear the other person's words — words that had become lost across the decades and centuries within this labyrinthine dream and its eventide bewilderment. It was a story, a story told by her to herself, a story reflected in thousands of shattered slivers of silver, echoing on and on, forever..."},{"id":"Book468","title":"Book468","filename":"Book468_EN.txt","text":"Tale of the Bird Chaser\n\nThis is a story of an old bird chaser.\nNorth of the kingdom lies a dense forest. It is home to a flock of birds that can mimic the words of humans. They often gather like a cloud by the break of the dawn. As they fly in the forest, iridescent hues dance on their spread wings, and their chatters echo round the tree crowns. But these creatures are not alone, for an old and frail man dressed in tattered rags always comes and spends all day chasing after them like a savage.\nJust as how a towering tree was once tender and delicate, the old man used to be fair and handsome. He grew up in a village by the forest. Agile and kind, he was much-loved by all. Every girl in the village adored him, but his heart fluttered only for his love, a young priestess serving in the forest who always fascinated him with miracles of the divine.\nThe young man often thought that he would give up anything to be with the girl, until death did them part.\nAlas, that which is sweet never lasts. A grueling war broke out, and the young were conscripted, including the man. Before he left for the battlefield, he saw his love weep for the first time. Teardrops rolled down her cheeks like dew falling from a green leaf — then down into his heart. Yet little did he know the actual reason behind the girl's melancholia. He made hasty promises, wishing to ease the girl's sorrow — one caused by departure, as he then naively believed.\nWith grief written all over her face, the girl gave no response to his beautiful vows. After a brief silence, she said she would send talking birds to relay her words of longing. It was an unusual use of power, but the young man took her act as a means to secure his love.\nSo he nodded.\nThe young man departed the next day to honor his duty to his kingdom. It would soon be over, he thought. But reality eventually proved him wrong — the war dragged on and on. It was not until stubble grew on his chin and his eyes and hands became battle-hardened that the dust finally settled.\nHis only solace in this brutal war was the birds from his hometown. As if guided by the gods, they always managed to come to him on quiet nights, carrying her words — the whispers of her bitter-sweet longing, telling him of changes in the village, or of a few short verses she wrote him.\nThe sustained separation had not diminished his love for her. Instead, if love was a monument, it would be driven into his heart.\nWhen the war finally ended, he hurried home to propose to his beloved, only to find that she had died of an acute illness on a cold night shortly after his departure.\nThe young man refused to accept it, for he had just been visited by a talking bird the previous day, when his young priestess read him beautiful prose through its mouth.\nHe broke into the girl's closed chamber. But as the sunlight filled the dim room, it stirred what was inside: countless enchanted birds waiting to be awakened from their rich slumber. In a single instant, the birds rushed past him, wings flapping by his ears, and flew through the open door into the sky like an ethereal cloud, returning to their home. At last, the young man stood alone, his love's empty room before him.\nIt finally dawned on him why the girl had made that most unusual arrangement with that saddened expression on her face the night they parted.\nIt had been an arrangement for a lifetime — on her dying bed, she must have taught the birds countless words, more than enough to fill his every night since with a flicker of light.\nBirds live far longer than humans think. From that day on, the young man has been chasing the talking birds in the forest. In their voices, he seeks to catch her lingering soul, to repent for his sin of scattering her love in the woods. Maddened yet tireless, the young man has not stopped his chase for a single day as he turned into a middle-aged man, then aged into an old man. The talking birds now speak of nothing new, and their numbers have dwindled. But what if there is still one that he has not yet met — one with something from her that he has not yet known? The obsession traps the bird chaser in the forest, and upon his face is written the toll of years.\nHe skillfully sets up traps very catch the birds and keeps them in a cage, stroking their necks, playing with them, and giving them the best cereals and clearest water. Then, he will say to them, \"Speak, Talking Birds, speak of my love, who the forest favored so dearly. Speak of what she taught you.\"\nAnd so, the generously-fed birds will tell such a story..."},{"id":"Book469","title":"Book469","filename":"Book469_EN.txt","text":"Notable progress has been made in Khaj-Nisut.

The results of their discoveries will show that treasures related to life and death may be hidden within the Court of Desolation.

He was just sitting there, slumped over, completely still. He didn't flinch even in the thunder and lightning, not even when the rain was pelting down on him. Then I realized, he must be sleeping! So I climbed up on top of him, threw my arms around that big old head of his, and twisted it as hard as I could. There was a clunking noise, followed by a loud boom, and suddenly his head fell off and rolled straight off the cliff! It smashed into a million pieces at the bottom.

When we observe the daily lives of the people of Mondstadt from a higher perspective, it is evident that the people share a carefree nature, which mostly stems from their bountiful and pleasant living conditions. The surplus grain produced became their source of brews, and the brews further nourished their easygoing temperament. Above all, the Anemo Archon never taught them how to make wine and revel — they discovered it themselves.\nBut I do not intend to make my readers think that we could do without archons. On the contrary, say, if Barbatos had not guided the warm monsoons to Mondstadt with his divine powers, would Mondstadt still be so bountiful as to produce the brews that it does?\nThe answer would be no. Mondstadt is an inland city and would have struggled to provide for itself if not for the grace of Barbatos. If we look back through history, we learn that Mondstadt is situated on a land that was once frozen, where the living conditions were harsh and brewing would be virtually impossible. It was the power of Barbatos that changed everything.\nA cumbersome preface indeed, but I hope that my readers keep one thing in mind when reading my humble book: while it is the power of archons that created our living environment, we should be conscious of the fact that what shapes our thinking, logic, culture, philosophy and aesthetics is not the archons themselves, but the objective environment that exists around us. This world around us is what we have inherited, and what this book shows is that the people of Teyvat have always been, and always will be, heirs to a divine legacy — but not to divinity itself."},{"id":"Book500","title":"Book500","filename":"Book500_EN.txt","text":"Merchant Log, Expedition No. 39\nDay 10 of the Fungi Invasion:\n...\nThankfully, we came across a group of farmers in the nearby area.

Kautilya had Elchingen partner up with him, keeping the most important evidence hidden. If it weren't for the Traveler and Paimon's help in providing crucial evidence, the matra might've spent a longer time investigating the duo's actions.\nThe Wisdom Orb and Floral Jelly were indeed derived from the \"Capturing Device\" and \"Withering Potion.\" The latter two share similarities to the Omni-Ubiquity Net from Inazuma, which originates from Liyue's Adeptus Arts. Therefore, one could say the two technologies are based on solid references. However, the \"Capturing Device\" and \"Withering Potion\" aren't thoroughly validated due to insufficient development time. They're experimental items created by Amurta researchers for controlling dangerous creatures. These items once resulted in a horrific accident, and therefore should no doubt be locked away forever.\nKautilya made use of his status and Elchingen's funds to bribe relevant personnel. He obtained samples and documentation, then hired a few talented students to work on enhancing the two products. By making them safer and more reliable, Kautilya would then use this tournament as a cover for his true intentions — causing damage in Sumeru.\nThe matra rounded up another group of Amurta scholars to develop a countermeasure that targeted Kautilya's backdoor command. They planted it into specific Wisdom Orbs and handed them out to the matra on shift at the arena. If anything happens, the countermeasure would be put to use.\nFortunately, everything went smoothly with the tournament. No one was hurt, and there were no property losses. The tournament even brought financial gain to Port Ormos.\nAs of now, all involved personnel within the Akademiya have been detained. They shall face just judgment. Sido, leader of this operation, has confirmed all locations of interest. Criminals at large are highly likely to show up around these areas. The Corps of Thirty can acquire them with no more than a limited number of people.\nAs for Elchingen, the results of the initial investigation reveals that 60 percent of his sponsor funds came from illegal sources. The rest were his business earnings in Sumeru. Because this Fatui informant is quite a complicated case, the Akademiya will arrange for specialized personnel to deal with this matter.\n...\n\nTraveler and Paimon:\nI have included Sido's report at the front of this letter. Take a look if you're interested — it may help you understand the situation better.\nThe enthusiastic participants and audience do not deserve to be deceived like this. I will be using Elchingen's business earnings as prize money for the participants and compensation for other relevant people. If the funds are not enough, the extra amount will be included in Kautilya's fine.\nThe Beast Tamers Tournament has a positive influence and might become as well-known as Genius Invokation TCG, so it doesn't need to discontinue just because of two schemers.

They seem to have been trapped here by the aggressive Fungi too, and have set up a temporary camp.\nThe kind farmers brought sufficient provisions and medicinal herbs, and almost saved all of us.\nBut there were still several people who did not make it...\nThe Fungi surrounding this area are increasing in number, and they're still in that berserk state.\nWe can't leave just yet, at least not before the Fungi are gone... if they ever leave.\nIt looks like we'll be staying here for a good while.\n...\n\nMerchant Log, Expedition No. 39\nDay 42 of the Fungi Invasion:\n...\nI never thought that I'd become trapped by a bunch of Fungi for so long. I still can't see any hope of getting away from this place.\nRabib took his axe and made an attempt to go fight the Fungi, but he was stopped by the other farmers. Everyone knows that none of us are going to last long without the leader of the farmers around...\nBut if the circumstances are enough to make the calmest and most composed farmer lose his cool, I can only imagine what the others feel. Everyone must be feeling pretty frustrated by now.\nThe Zaytun Peaches we picked from nearby areas and the remaining provisions are going to last a few more weeks.\nFollowing the farmers' suggestions, we have started looking for suitable seeds to grow our own food.\nAnd the camp needs an expansion. We have to make plans for the long term — we might eventually have to turn this place into a small village.\nA village full of Fungi victims? How absurd...\nHopefully, we'll manage to keep ourselves from starving to death before the crops mature.\n...\n\n\nMerchant Log, Expedition No. 39\nDay 133 of the Fungi Invasion:\n...\nAfter all these days being trapped by the Fungi, it was the first time we met people from outside.\nThe three of them claimed to be researchers from the Akademiya and showed us proof of identification. But they were dressed nothing different from common civilians, as if they were trying to keep a low profile.\nThe mercenaries they hired had rather formidable and ruthless looks. Clearly they were seasoned professionals, or they couldn't have broken through the siege of Fungi to get here.\nThe leading researcher promised that they'll let us leave with them once they're done investigating.\nBut they demanded our absolute secrecy on the Fungi assaults. They also declared that they would leave no trace of this village's existence afterward.\nThen they gave Rabib and me a generous sum of Mora for our cooperation and asked us to convince those who were most emotionally unstable to follow their orders.\nEven without their request, I would've gone ahead and comforted everyone anyway. As for my share of Mora, I'm planning to leave it to the families of those who couldn't make it.\nAs things stand, I myself also want to figure out why the Fungi assaulted us out of the blue.\n...\n\nMerchant Log, Expedition No. 39\nDay 3 of the investigation:\n...\nThe leading researcher still refuses to tell us his name. Perhaps he feels embarrassed for being sent here to clean up after this mess.\nRegardless, the three researchers seemed unfamiliar with the landscape around, and their mercenaries were clever enough to not be overly cautious. When I offered to help them as a guide, they accepted my offer.\nSo I got the chance to join them in the investigation. I also took the opportunity to look through the researchers' materials while they were asleep.\nIn the least, I must find out why some of us were killed. Their lives shouldn't have been taken away for no reason.\nThe mercenaries were quite reasonable and turned a blind eye to my actions. They must've understood the perils of the task they had undertaken.\nWhen you and your companions are on the same page concerning the dangers, you are more likely to avoid accidents.\n...\n\nMerchant Log, Expedition No. 39\nDay 7 of the Investigation:\n...\nThe researchers seem to be planning to use some kind of capturing device to control the aggressive Fungi.\nThe codename of the device is... a string of complicated terminology. They've also included a license of approval from the Akademiya...\nIn addition, they're preparing something called the Withering Potion to suppress the Fungi's activity, making them easier to control.\nThe Withering Potion also came with complex notes and official approval from the Akademiya.\nAnyway, I'll record the information down for now.\n...\n(The bottom half of this page is filled with complex terms and comments. It's not hard to infer that whoever wrote them down did so by copying the researcher's notes word by word under a dim light...)\n\n\nMerchant Log, Expedition No. 39\nDay 13 of the Investigation:\n...\nWe failed again. When we returned to the village, two seriously wounded mercenaries insisted on quitting.\nBefore going to bed, I heard the lead researcher arguing with a few subordinates.\nOne of them tried to convince the lead researcher to give up on the Withering Potion, saying that they have gotten its function wrong from the very beginning. The outcome contradicted their expectations, and it could very well lead to their deaths.\nAnother subordinate was yelling curses at an unfamiliar person. Judging from the details of their argument, it seems like someone has made a grave mistake.\nThey're here to settle this mess, but upon witnessing the state of things, they start planning to drop everything and run.\nSomething doesn't feel right, but I still need more evidence to make sure...\n...\n\n\nContents compiled after combining the clues:\n(The device remnants and the remains of the files that Dori gave you contain the same license of approval as the device recorded in the notes has. Evidently, these devices were considered technologically identical by the Akademiya.)\n(Similarly, the formula for floral jelly shares many basic ingredients and medicinal principles with the Withering Potion from the notes. The only difference is that the amount of certain active ingredients applied in the Floral Jelly is much lower than that of the Withering Potion. Also, protective ingredients and so-called stabilizers were added to the Floral Jelly.)\n(At this point, it can be roughly deduced that the remnants of the instrument that the organizer of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament attempted to destroy utilized the technological outcomes of the capturing device.)\n(And the Floral Jelly can be deemed as an upgrade of the Withering Potion with enhanced safety that can trigger a temporary boost to the activity of Fungi and let them gain some special powers while being activated.)\n"},{"id":"Book505","title":"Book505","filename":"Book505_EN.txt","text":"\nDetails: This text belongs to a series of works sponsored by the Vahumana's \"Veilcutter\" project. It has yet to be numbered.\n\nAuthor: Aqaba\n\nAbstract: The Tatarasuna area has always been a major pillar of Inazuma's smithing industry. Two incidents have occurred here, and the details behind the first are vague at best. I believe, however, that there might be a hidden history behind the events that transpired. Hence, this paper will attempt to analyze what may have unfolded from the available data.\n\n\nGlossary: Tatarasuna area; Raiden Gokaden; Mikoshi Nagamasa; Kabukimono\n\nIntroduction: This paper continues and expands the work of my mentor, Mr. Rumi, in his report on \"The Haply Hidden Tales of Tatarasuna,\" and is intended to further this avenue of research. According to the data, the blade-forging techniques of Inazuma were originally handed down from the Electro Archon, also known as the Raiden Shogun. Using the arts they inherited from their Archon, the people of Inazuma devoted themselves to the process of forging. However, strange rumors that do not quite fit the steely nature of metalwork yet linger about Tatarasuna, which was a central pillar of the forging industry. There, the Mikoshi and Niwa clans, along with an eccentric puppet, serve as the three windows of insight we need to investigate the truth behind what happened.\n\n\nBody\n\nStrange notes from the Tatarasuna area. Their contents are as follows:\n\n1\n\"...Perhaps I overstep, but I think that Sir Nagamasa's mood grows better when he forges blades...\"\n\"...The obsession to cleanse the stain of the name 'Mikoshi' must eat at him...\"\n\"...Also, Sir Katsuragi discovered a nameless eccentric while patrolling around Nazuchi Beach...\"\n\n2\n\"...The Inspector bought a certain number of Jade Steel ingots...\"\n\"...Sir Katsuragi discussed matters of smithing deep into the night with the Vice Armory Officer.\"\n\n\n3\n\"...We at last made a single nagamaki.

Among the seven notes, six seem to be of good physical integrity, though they all look quite old, while the last one looks more recent. I believe that the first six notes and the last are of different time periods, though the gulf in years between them needs to be verified. The contents of the first six should also be related to each other, as the incidents mentioned are quite consistent with one another.\nRumi once mentioned in \"The Haply Hidden Tales of Tatarasuna\" (hereafter known as \"Hidden Tales\") that in the past, researchers from Sumeru had investigated the cultural histories of Tatarasuna and Inazuma. Though the place has fallen into some degree of disrepair since the \"Hidden Tales\" were written, things have improved since the time when I wrote my original article. Regardless, what used to be an area of major industry remains a place most inhospitable, and residents of Tatarasuna may be found living and dwelling by the waters. The residents, when questioned, told the researchers of Tatarasuna's golden age centuries ago, when it was administered by Armory Officer Niwa, Vice Armory Officer Miyazaki, and Inspector Mikoshi Nagamasa. Yet, the elders among the locals with deeper ties to the region also seemed to stress the fact that there were strange rumors surrounding their homeland's past.\nA great many of these rumors revolved around the \"youkai\" who are so very characteristic of Inazuma's folk histories. A very small number, however, mentioned the word \"puppet.\" It should be known that puppets are neither traditional nor common youkai in Inazuma. This fact drew the attention of the researchers to delve further, and eventually, the following pieces of information came to light:\n- A puppet did once appear in Tatarasuna. Its visage was elegant, its apparel impeccable, and the way it dressed hid all the joint lines on its body. If no one were to mention that it was indeed a puppet, it would be hard to tell at all. Additionally, this puppet seemed to possess special joint lines that would fade with time, potentially even disappearing altogether, which would perhaps eventually make the puppet seem entirely human.\n- The name of the puppet was known to almost none. Some folk claimed to have spotted it appearing around Tatarasuna, while others mentioned encountering it in the central regions of the area. Some even claimed that it would frequent the beach. Tales spread of it standing beside the sea and gazing across the waters toward Inazuma City. What it was that the puppet was gazing at remains a mystery.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the six notes all document a certain \"nameless eccentric.\" The \"eccentric,\" which can also be read as \"Kabukimono,\" is usually used in Inazuma to refer to a figure who dresses or behaves in a peculiar manner. It is understandable, therefore, why this character would have left such an impression. Should the people of Tatarasuna indeed have had a puppet in their midst incurring mass panic — a good possibility considering the coexistence between youkai and humans in Inazuma at large — then the puppet would have very likely become a local resident. What is less well-known is if \"the Kabukimono\" was just another title for this puppet. Perhaps because it was uniquely dressed to distract attention from its more special characteristics. A workable theory, but one that still lacks enough evidence to support it. Still, it can be retained as an analytical lens of sorts.\n\nA list of individuals related to Tatarasuna has been compiled here based on historical documents from Inazuma. Starting from the administrators, the records are as follows:\n\nArmory Officer — Niwa\nFull name Niwa Hisahide. He was the inheritor of the Isshin Art, and successor to the Niwa Clan. His family, along with the Akame and Kaedehara clans, were together known as the \"Isshin Sansaku.\" Records show that Niwa was a modest and intelligent individual who displayed remarkable talent in the administration of territory and people. His eventual whereabouts are unknown, but he was suspected to have left Tatarasuna with his family following the incident.\n\nVice Armory Officer — Miyazaki\nFull name Miyazaki Kaneo. He was Niwa's second-in-command. His origins are unknown, and he primarily assisted Niwa in forging and personnel management. He was of affable temperament and had many friends in the region, including one Mikoshi Nagamasa.\n\nInspector — Mikoshi Nagamasa\nThe successor of the Mikoshi Clan, adopted son to oni warrior Mikoshi Chiyo, and the younger adopted brother to Mikoshi Michihiro, also known as \"Iwakura the Successor.\" With his mother missing and abandoned by his brother, Nagamasa alone bore the family name, striving daily to wipe the shame from their history. Though records state that Mikoshi Nagamasa was a stubborn figure, he was also noted to be a person of moral virtue and integrity. It has been noted in various records that he practiced forging swords for self-cultivation, and specially requested special instruction from Miyazaki to further his capabilities. However, after the famous blade, Daitatara Nagamasa, was forged, he used it to slay his subordinate, Katsuragi, for reasons unknown at present.\n\nSubordinate — Katsuragi\nKatsuragi's full name and background remain unknown. Despite all the materials I have sorted through, I have yet to find anymore additional personal information regarding him. As one of Mikoshi Nagamasa's subordinates, he was a loyal warrior who had been saved by Nagamasa in his youth. From then on, he swore to stick by his lord through thick and thin and to give his life in service if it was but asked of him.\n\nKabukimono\nFull name unknown. Background unknown. From the many sources I have compiled combined with Rumi's personal observations, this character might have been the puppet mentioned in the rumors. The Kabukimono was a figure of fashionable grace and gentleness. According to the \"Hidden Tales,\" he was brought back to Tatarasuna by Katsuragi, and became a member of the community. When the Kabukimono first arrived in Tatarasuna, he knew nothing of cleaning, cooking, or any work of meticulous nature. The locals taught him their skills over time, showing him how to clean his attire, dance, and craft small trinkets. Records state that the Kabukimono was there when the \"Daitatara Nagamasa\" was forged, though his trail ends before Mikoshi Nagamasa slew Katsuragi. I believe that the Kabukimono was indeed the aforementioned puppet, and that he quite likely had a hand in Katsuragi's death.\n\n\n(It seems that the rest of this paper remains unfinished... One thing is for sure, though — a lot of thought was put into it.)\n"},{"id":"Book506","title":"Book506","filename":"Book506_EN.txt","text":"\nAuthor: Sawada\n\n\nExtract I\n\n...\n...\nA man arrived in Tatarasuna around three in the afternoon. From afar, he spied laborers walking along the mountain roads toward the factories, their shoes scuffing along the jutting stones. They walked like people convinced that so long as they reached the fire raging in the mountain's belly, they might extract from it gems beyond price. The mood that the sight inspired was ineffable, beyond mere description for those not present to witness it.\nThe man barked a cheerful greeting and sprinted to join the procession. There, a towering character who stood half a head taller greeted him with a heavy slap on the back, and yet, his words were filled with respect: \"Do my eyes deceive me? Sir Miyazaki! I cannot think that the return trip here from Inazuma City could have been easy on you.\"\nMiyazaki smiled like a young man taking the first steps on their journey, expression relaxed. \"Why Katsuragi, Inazuma is the realm of the Almighty Shogun. I sailed upon the fastest ship, strode upon the swiftest sea routes. What dangers could I have possibly faced?\"\n\"And what about the good news?\"\n\"There was some... Naturally.\" The two burst into uproarious laughter, roughhousing with the other workers until the path's end.\n\nA young man dressed in a linen shirt and wearing a headscarf gazed into the dancing flames of the furnace before him.\nNow, the flames of a forge are unlike any other, for their intensity affects the resulting integrity of both metal and blade. So too, then, was the flame-watcher an unusual individual. At his fingertips sat a lizard, and on his face he wore a smile.\nThe workshop was huge, and the furnace was deeper within. A reasonable person might think that there should have been many working alongside the watcher, yet he stood alone. Only when Katsuragi and Miyazaki strode into the room did the watcher turn.\nThis watcher was Niwa, Armory Officer and administrator of Tatarasuna. Born to the Niwa Clan, which served as one of the three pillars of the Isshin Art, Niwa never argued with his siblings and was a worthy successor by all accounts. The post he received as a result of his high standing with those in power served as a statement unto itself.\nMiyazaki handed a well-bundled text to Niwa as he adjusted his expression and said: \"It is as you have said, sir. The elders of your clan in the city do not think highly of our plan. Yet I still believe it to be worth a try. As such, I have found the proper vendors and procured the materials that you requested.\"\nNiwa studied the text and nodded. \"We should try some of these new forging techniques, whether Kaedehara says yea or nay.\"\nKatsuragi frowned, and with a sigh he said: \"Forging is a precise and difficult undertaking. You know this better than most, sirs, and still, you seek improvement each day with terrifying drive! Ah, should my lord Nagamasa hear this, the sourness in his face shall be hard to miss.\"\nNiwa smiled, replying: \"And how goes the forging of your lord's great blade, Katsuragi?\"\nKatsuragi neither wanted to shame his master nor lie to his two friends, and yet he could not think of any way to deflect, and so groused: \"I see your ears are as keen as your hands, Sir Niwa. The jokes of us unlearned men are as nothing before you.\"\nMiyazaki hid his grin. Upon hearing this, Niwa released the lizard from his hand into Katsuragi's palm. But just as more words were to be exchanged, someone came walking nearby, their footsteps light with the celerity of youth. The head that peeked in was round and, in the light of the fires, looked like an oiled jewel.\nThe young man placed some boxed food at the side, and nodding, he prepared to leave. Katsuragi called out after him: \"What about your share? Aren't you going to eat it?\"\nThe young man, upon hearing those words, found himself slightly at a loss. After a while, he answered: \"...Very well. I'll try it.\"\n\"You are welcome to the food. We all eat the same fare, after all,\" Niwa said. The man nodded and left, seemingly deep in thought.\n\n\nExtract II\n\n...\n...\nThe Kabukimono was by the coast.\nSunset fell to the accompaniment of darkness. The bands of twilight showed themselves naught, for in their place did thunderclouds roil, grumbling the omens of a coming rainstorm.\nDarkness filled the flesh of the sea and the dusk bade the clouds to kneel upon the land, its supplication mirroring the Kabukimono, with knees bent and face pointed toward the waters.\nNone passed that way, and none knew what he was waiting for in silence.\nTime passed, unmeasured and uncounted, till a black cloud suddenly tore free from the sky and began to circle the Kabukimono, bearing down on him like a nightmare. Though he was not aware at first, after his studying gaze was refined by time, he understood: this cloud had marked him from the very start.\nOutbound, a fishing boat drew near, the lights of its bow flickering in and out of sight beneath falling sheets of rain. A mist unspooled across the area, stealing sight from the fisherman. Repeatedly, he exclaimed: \"It is but dusk. How are my eyes darkened? Is there anyone that can deliver my boat upon safe tides?\"\nLike a falling spear, the black cloud reached the bottom of the boat, and was joined in its bereftness of direction. Like a charging beast, they plunged into the shoreline. Scant steps away, the Kabukimono stood idle, slanting his head to study the grand wreck.\nNaught but half an arm was left of the one who had cried out for help, and with a \"plop,\" it landed at the Kabukimono's feet. He crouched to better study the object, straining against the urge to take a bite out of it.\nYet, he did not, for the dark clouds swirling down had already picked the remnants of the ship clean. The Kabukimono stared at it blankly, like an awakening dreamer. When he returned to himself, the clouds had scattered, as if they had never been there at all. As for the ship... Could it have been struck down by a storm? Who was to know? Not the Kabukimono...\n\n\nExtract III\n\n...\n...\nKatsuragi rushed to the doorway and shouted: \"My lord! Things go ill at the furnace. I have searched for Sir Niwa, but there is no trace of him. And much time has passed since Sir Miyazaki left to seek aid, but he has yet to send us any missive. Look...\"\nMikoshi Nagamasa turned slowly, his face grave as one attending a funeral. He spoke then, his words heavy-laden: \"I wish not to say such words, Katsuragi... But Sir Miyazaki may never return.\"\nKatsuragi peered past Nagamasa's broad, stiff shoulders, beyond the windows. The clouds above boiled in waves of black, as if darkness now was the only weather, and might even morph into an abyssal beast and devour Tatarasuna whole.\nOver ten people had already perished. That was why... Why...\nKatsuragi recoiled as if struck. Yes! It was coming back to him now, in dribs and drabs... That was why they had to set out to seek aid!\nMiyazaki had been the first to set sail. The clouds had only just begun to form then. Traveling from Tatarasuna to Inazuma to ask for support was normally no great feat, and yet, there had been no sign of his return.\nThen a second ship was sent, followed by a third, and a fourth... Till the Kabukimono himself had departed upon the tides, under foul skies and ominous fortunes. It had been Katsuragi who had brought him back and treated him as his own, and it pained him greatly to see the lad go. Yet, the situation in Tatarasuna was severe. Even should they sacrifice more lives, it would have been worth it to gain assistance from Inazuma City.\n\nNiwa was gone, and none could find him. Afterward, Nagamasa led a search party into the mountains and the area around the furnace, all to no avail. Folk began to wonder if Niwa might have encountered an accident, but worry soon turned to suspicion, and they wondered if he had fled, unwilling to bear the sin of having caused these incidents.\nThe people grew ever more suspicious, and Nagamasa himself strained against his discontent and fury. His face had grown to resemble the rumbling clouds above.\nSuddenly, a figure flashed by. Their presence did not go unnoticed by Nagamasa. He drew his blade and cut, though he only nicked the silken veil the intruder wore. For a moment, they swayed, and then, like a marionette pulled by strings, they moved behind Nagamasa, laughing darkly: \"Are you seeking someone, my lord? Niwa, perhaps?\"\nNagamasa bellowed in fury: \"You dare address Sir Niwa directly?\" Yet, the figure parted like mist before his falling blade, only to re-materialize beyond reach but not beyond sight — a ghastly apparition indeed.\n\"Was it you who slew my people?\" Nagamasa howled and charged, held back only by Katsuragi's desperate grip. As his senses returned to him, he realized he was but an inch away from falling into the furnace.\n\n\n(It seems that the rest of this work remains unfinished...

This fact drew the attention of the researchers to delve further, and eventually, the following pieces of information came to light:</color>\n<color=#FFCC33>- A foreign mechanic once visited Tatarasuna. Reportedly, the reason for his immigration was to exchange knowledge and forge ties with the locals. However, the mechanic seemed to behave suspiciously, often wandering around essential or restricted areas. And if someone tried to turn him away, they would only earn incomprehensible mumbles from his lips.</color>\n<color=#FFCC33>- The mechanic often stared into the furnace, seemingly to check on its condition. Unsettlingly, he also spent a substantial amount of time watching the local residents.</color>\n\n<color=#FFCC33>Judging from the era, it was not uncommon to see cross-cultural exchanges of technical knowledge in places such as Tatarasuna. After traveling across the tides, foreign experts being welcome in the region was likely not unreasonable either. Yet, calamity came not long after this exchange of knowledge, which hints at high potential for causation between these events. However, some current residents believe that these assumptions were merely the results of their forebears' overactive imaginations attempting to theorize how things actually unfolded.</color>\n\nA list of individuals related to Tatarasuna has been compiled here based on historical documents from Inazuma. Starting from the administrators, the records are as follows:\n\nArmory Officer — Niwa\nFull name Niwa Hisahide. He was the inheritor of the Isshin Art, and successor to the Niwa Clan. His family, along with the Akame and Kaedehara clans, were together known as the \"Isshin Sansaku.\" Records show that Niwa was a modest and intelligent individual who displayed remarkable talent in the administration of territory and people. His eventual whereabouts are unknown, but he was suspected to have left Tatarasuna with his family following the incident.\n\nVice Armory Officer — Miyazaki\nFull name Miyazaki Kaneo. He was Niwa's second-in-command. His origins are unknown, and he primarily assisted Niwa in forging and personnel management. He was of affable temperament and had many friends in the region, including one Mikoshi Nagamasa.\n\nInspector — Mikoshi Nagamasa\nThe successor of the Mikoshi Clan, adopted son to oni warrior Mikoshi Chiyo, and the younger adopted brother to Mikoshi Michihiro, also known as \"Iwakura the Successor.\" With his mother missing and abandoned by his brother, Nagamasa alone bore the family name, striving daily to wipe the shame from their history. Though records state that Mikoshi Nagamasa was a stubborn figure, he was also noted to be a person of moral virtue and integrity. It has been noted in various records that he practiced forging swords for self-cultivation, and specially requested special instruction from Miyazaki to further his capabilities. However, after the famous blade, Daitatara Nagamasa, was forged, he used it to slay his subordinate, Katsuragi, for reasons unknown at present.\n\nSubordinate — Katsuragi\nKatsuragi's full name and background remain unknown. Despite all the materials I have sorted through, I have yet to find anymore additional personal information regarding him. As one of Mikoshi Nagamasa's subordinates, he was a loyal warrior who had been saved by Nagamasa in his youth. From then on, he swore to stick by his lord through thick and thin and to give his life in service if it was but asked of him.\n\n<color=#FFCC33>The Mechanic</color>\n<color=#FFCC33>Long have I delved through many texts and documents, but I was ultimately unable to decipher even a specter of a clue as to his background. Still, mentions of the mechanic grew scarcer in the aftermath of the Tatarasuna incident. I speculate that, instead of the mechanic possibly being a figure woven from over-ripe imaginations, he actually did exist, and perhaps even had a hand in the events that took place in Tatarasuna.</color>\n\n\n(It seems that the rest of this paper remains unfinished... One thing is for sure, though — a lot of thought was put into it.)\n"},{"id":"Book508","title":"Book508","filename":"Book508_EN.txt","text":"\nAuthor: Sawada\n\n\nExtract I\n\n...\n...\nA man arrived in Tatarasuna around three in the afternoon. From afar, he spied laborers walking along the mountain roads toward the factories, their shoes scuffing along the jutting stones. They walked like people convinced that so long as they reached the fire raging in the mountain's belly, they might extract from it gems beyond price. The mood that the sight inspired was ineffable, beyond mere description for those not present to witness it.\nThe man barked a cheerful greeting and sprinted to join the procession. There, a towering character who stood half a head taller greeted him with a heavy slap on the back, and yet, his words were filled with respect: \"Do my eyes deceive me? Sir Miyazaki! I cannot think that the return trip here from Inazuma City could have been easy on you.\"\nMiyazaki smiled like a young man taking the first steps on their journey, expression relaxed. \"Why Katsuragi, Inazuma is the realm of the Almighty Shogun. I sailed upon the fastest ship, strode upon the swiftest sea routes. What dangers could I have possibly faced?\"\n\"And what about the good news?\"\n\"There was some... Naturally.\" The two burst into uproarious laughter, roughhousing with the other workers until the path's end.\n\nA young man dressed in a linen shirt and wearing a headscarf gazed into the dancing flames of the furnace before him.\nNow, the flames of a forge are unlike any other, for their intensity affects the resulting integrity of both metal and blade. So too, then, was the flame-watcher an unusual individual. At his fingertips sat a lizard, and on his face he wore a smile.\nThe workshop was huge, and the furnace was deeper within. A reasonable person might think that there should have been many working alongside the watcher, yet he stood alone. Only when Katsuragi and Miyazaki strode into the room did the watcher turn.\nThis watcher was Niwa, Armory Officer and administrator of Tatarasuna. Born to the Niwa Clan, which served as one of the three pillars of the Isshin Art, Niwa never argued with his siblings and was a worthy successor by all accounts. The post he received as a result of his high standing with those in power served as a statement unto itself.\nMiyazaki handed a well-bundled text to Niwa as he adjusted his expression and said: \"It is as you have said, sir. The elders of your clan in the city do not think highly of our plan. Yet I still believe it to be worth a try. As such, I have found the proper vendors and procured the materials that you requested.\"\nNiwa studied the text and nodded. \"We should try some of these new forging techniques, whether Kaedehara says yea or nay.\"\nKatsuragi frowned, and with a sigh he said: \"Forging is a precise and difficult undertaking. You know this better than most, sirs, and still, you seek improvement each day with terrifying drive! Ah, should my lord Nagamasa hear this, the sourness in his face shall be hard to miss.\"\nNiwa smiled, replying: \"And how goes the forging of your lord's great blade, Katsuragi?\"\nKatsuragi neither wanted to shame his master nor lie to his two friends, and yet he could not think of any way to deflect, and so groused: \"I see your ears are as keen as your hands, Sir Niwa. The jokes of us unlearned men are as nothing before you.\"\n<color=#FFCC33>Miyazaki hid his grin. Upon hearing this, Niwa released the lizard from his hand into Katsuragi's palm. But just as more words were to be exchanged, someone came walking nearby, their footsteps steady and confident. The head that appeared by the door was that of one from abroad. The newcomer placed some lunchboxes to one side, nodded, and made to leave. Katsuragi called out after him. \"Sir, what about your meal? Are you not hungry?\"</color>\n<color=#FFCC33>The man smiled upon hearing Katsuragi's words. \"I already ate. I hope that you, my lords, may also find time to sate your hunger soon.\"</color>\n<color=#FFCC33>\"You are our guest, sir. To see you help in these trifling matters fills me with embarrassment,\" Niwa said with sincerity.</color>\n<color=#FFCC33>The man smiled, as if it was no matter. Then, with a nod, he departed.</color>\n\n\nExtract II\n\n...\n...\nThe stranger, a foreign mechanic, stood next to the coast.\nSunset fell to the accompaniment of darkness. The bands of twilight showed themselves naught, for in their place did thunderclouds roil, grumbling the omens of a coming rainstorm.\nDarkness filled the flesh of the sea and the dusk bade the clouds to kneel upon the land. But the man stood uncowed, merely gazing into the distance, radiating bloodthirst.\nNone passed him by, and none knew what he was plotting.\nTime passed, unmeasured and uncounted, till a black cloud suddenly tore free from the sky and began to circle the mechanic, bearing down on him like an omen. He then caressed the dark mist, as if it was a part of his flesh.\nOutbound, a fishing boat drew near, the lights of its bow flickering in and out of sight beneath falling sheets of rain. A mist unspooled across the area, stealing sight from the fisherman. Repeatedly, he exclaimed: \"It is but dusk. How are my eyes darkened? Is there anyone that can deliver my boat upon safe tides?\"\n<color=#FFCC33>Like a falling spear, the black cloud reached the bottom of the boat, and was joined in its bereftness of direction. Like a charging beast, they plunged into the shoreline. Scant steps away, the mechanic laughed, slowly approaching the grand wreck.</color> \n<color=#FFCC33>Naught but half an arm was left of the one who had cried out for help, and with a \"plop,\" it landed at the mechanic's feet, who crouched to better study the object, straining against the urge to take a bite.</color>\n<color=#FFCC33>Yet, he did not, for the dark clouds swirling down had already picked the remnants of the ship clean.</color>\n\n\nExtract III\n\n...\n...\nKatsuragi rushed to the doorway and shouted: \"My lord! Things go ill at the furnace. I have searched for Sir Niwa, but there is no trace of him. And much time has passed since Sir Miyazaki left to seek aid, but he has yet to send us any missive. Look...\"\nMikoshi Nagamasa turned slowly, his face grave as one attending a funeral. He spoke then, his words heavy-laden: \"I wish not to say such words, Katsuragi... But Sir Miyazaki may never return.\"\nKatsuragi peered past Nagamasa's broad, stiff shoulders, beyond the windows. The clouds above boiled in waves of black, as if darkness now was the only weather, and might even morph into an abyssal beast and devour Tatarasuna whole.\nOver ten people had already perished. That was why... Why...\nKatsuragi recoiled as if struck. Yes! It was coming back to him now, in dribs and drabs... That was why they had to set out to seek aid!\nMiyazaki had been the first to set sail. The clouds had only just begun to form then. Traveling from Tatarasuna to Inazuma to ask for support was normally no great feat, and yet, there had been no sign of his return.\n<color=#FFCC33>Then a second ship was sent, followed by a third, and a fourth... Each who left to seek salvation did so under foul skies and bleak fortunes. Reason dictated that they should not have risked anyone else, but the situation in Tatarasuna was severe. They needed to gain aid from Inazuma, even should it cost them more lives.</color>\n\nNiwa was gone, and none could find him. Afterward, Nagamasa led a search party into the mountains and the area around the furnace, all to no avail. Folk began to wonder if Niwa might have encountered an accident, but worry soon turned to suspicion, and they wondered if he had fled, unwilling to bear the sin of having caused these incidents.\nThe people grew ever more suspicious, and Nagamasa himself strained against his discontent and fury. His face had grown to resemble the rumbling clouds above.\nSuddenly, a figure flashed by. Their presence did not go unnoticed by Nagamasa. He drew his blade and cut, but in a flash, the evil spirit had shifted behind him, laughing darkly: \"Are you seeking someone, my lord? Niwa, perhaps?\"\nNagamasa bellowed in fury: \"You dare address Sir Niwa directly?\" Yet, the figure parted like mist before his falling blade, only to re-materialize beyond reach but not beyond sight — a ghastly apparition indeed.\n\"Was it you who slew my people?\" Nagamasa howled and charged, held back only by Katsuragi's desperate grip. As his senses returned to him, he realized he was but an inch away from falling into the furnace.\n\n\n(It seems that the rest of this work remains unfinished...

Take care of them for me now, and don't lose them — I spent a whole night writing them down.\n\nI'm sure you want to ask why I'm in such a rush to go to Fontaine. Well, that's a long story. Do you remember that fellow from Fontaine named Nète? After that day, he's constantly tried to convince me to help \"advertise\" for him. Honestly, I could not be bothered with him, but he seems to have no sense of shame at all. Each time I refuse, and each time he comes back with a grander offer than before... Eventually, he told me that he'd be willing to pay me as much as I asked, so long as I help.\n\nParvaneh feels that we should stay away from this person, for fear that he might make a villain out of me yet.

Instead, he wanted to \"sponsor\" our journey.\n\nAccording to him, he will pay for all our expenses if we agree to go to Fontaine next and has promised not to interfere with our business there in the least, or any business we may have elsewhere afterward. He even signed a contract with us — and it's a thick one, alright. Parvaneh spent a few hours combing through it, and she ultimately found nothing wrong with it (if you can believe that!) — apart from an insistence that we must accept an \"interview\"...\n\nI'm not sure what this fellow actually plans on doing, but since he's made us this offer... Well, I guess that it wouldn't hurt to make a trip to Fontaine.\n\nWhatever the case, we'll be heading there with Nète for the time being.\n\nWith Parvaneh around, he won't have any time to even think of doing something untoward, and with the old man and Julie on the case, he's very unlikely to try to use force.

The last time I took them off to pour the water out, a frog jumped out.\n\nFrom the scale of this ruin, I suspect it is the temple that provided safe refuge for civilians during the Archon War several millennia ago. I've heard that the God of Salt built such a place. Liyue folklore holds that she was the gentlest of the gods. In the brutality and chaos of wartime, human beings were puny and disposable. But the Salt God refused to join the other gods in their senseless battle for dominance, instead choosing to give shelter to those dispossessed by the war. She brought them here to build a new settlement. She showed them kindness and comfort. And even as global upheaval ushered in the end of an epoch, she worked tirelessly to bring about a return to peace between the gods.\n\nIt seems that most parts of the ancient city have sunk into the riverbed of Bishui River. It's fortunate that the foundation of the temple is still here after all this time.\n\nShe amassed a group of followers who settled in the area now known as Sal Terrae and lived a humble existence. The city stood for several centuries, finally falling with the downfall of the god herself.\n\nThe gentlest of the gods fell not in battle at the hand of the other gods. She fell at the hand of one of her own people, the people she had loved so dearly.\n\nHe was the first king of the people, and also the last. He had once loved the God of Salt just as the rest did, but as a mere mortal, he ultimately could not fathom the self-sacrificial love the god embodied. He sought after military might, in the hope that the city might be able to hold its own in defense and attack. And so, to demonstrate that gentleness was a virtue unfit for the times, he took a sword and ended the life of the lone, defenseless god. No sooner had she met her demise than the temple itself collapsed, and the people's city crumbled like salt into the earth.\n\nAs for the treacherous king's fate, theories abound but none are certain. Some say he continued to reign in solitude from the ruins for centuries, finally turning to dust long after the cries of war had subsided, the ruins had been engulfed by the river, and insects had hollowed out his scepter. Other say that he took his own life after taking that of the god, unable to bear the guilt of deicide that weighed upon his conscience. In any case, the people on whom the Salt God had once looked so fondly became scattered across Liyue. In the safe haven of Liyue Harbor, under the rule of the Geo Archon, they and their stories survived, and that is why we still hear about them to this day.\n\nRumors say that the Salt God's body can still be found somewhere in the depths of the ruins. Though her body has turned to salt, it still maintains her posture from the moment she was struck by the king's sword.\n\nIt looks like we're in for some heavy rain: dark clouds are gathering as far as the eye can see. I'd better get moving. I'm going to head northwest to Mt. Qingce. Hopefully I can make it there before the rain gets too heavy.

The remaining samurai surrounded him and eventually slew him with great effort.\nBefore his death, he cried in a frenzy, \"The Raiden Gokaden should never have existed! Without them, I wouldn't have...\" But he didn't live to finish his final words.\n\nLater on, I learned that this person's interference was the cause behind the ill-fated forging. Lord Kamisato knew the significance of this event, but he remained silent, fearing that careless talk might drag others into what might be considered a treasonous crime. Despite his serious wounds, he insisted that we were wounded by the fleeing personnel, and advised me to remain silent.

I waste so much paper every year... I do hope the Dendro Archon won't mind.\n\nI have arrived at a mountain lake located high on Mt. Aocang. To get here, I had to hike up a winding dirt trail, make my way across perilous wooden walkways built by herb gatherers in ancient times, and then scale a steep, wet cliff. I was told by some fishermen that the lake is a thousand furlongs deep, but after taking a dip in the water I can safely say that their statements were pure hyperbole.\n\nThe Qingce Village elders were right after all: the mountain lake's water is sweet and warm. This place certainly lives up to its reputation as a celestial paradise! Back when I had just arrived in Jueyun Karst, an old farmer told me that the adepti possess a mysterious magical ability that lets them turn into mist and roam in the sea of clouds. I dismissed it as an old wives' tale at the time, but seeing the way the mist over the lake rises up to the summit and merges together with the sea of clouds, it does make me wonder... The adeptus I've been searching for could be roaming the clouds at the summit right now, for all I know, and I would be completely oblivious to it.\n\nI headed east down Mt. Aocang and ended up thoroughly lost in a thick forest. Finally, I came to a clearing and discovered I was back at the banks of the Bishui River. I have an excellent view of the surrounding area here, so I think this is where I'll camp for the night.\n\nWhile I was sorting through my things at the camp, I met a young lady who looked like she was out on a treasure hunt.

Aocang:\n\n\"Legends tell of an adeptus who lives beside a lake at the foot of Mt. Aocang on the northern side. If that's true, then that's sure to be where the adeptus keeps their secret treasure, too... Mwuhahaha, I know exactly what I'll do when I get my hands on that treasure!\"\n\nThen she quickly changed her tune, as if suddenly realizing how she sounded: \"I...

It accompanied me over mountains and hills and across vast, empty deserts, sustaining me for several decades.\nPlease allow me to use it to pay you a warrior's tribute, as well as to give you my best wishes.\n\nI was once an ordinary mercenary who chose to live and fight in solitude. My reason for becoming a sellsword was simple: I wished to exact revenge on the bandits that terrorized the land.\nWhen I was still very young, my family's caravan fell to a bandit attack. My parents, who rode at the head of the caravan, never returned.\nI started treading this path to eradicate violence and greed. Swearing to eliminate the bandits to the last man, I set out to eliminate all the suffering they could cause. My methods were so extreme that even other mercenary groups could not understand my doings.\n\nAll things were as they should be. Eventually, one day, there would be no bandits, or there would be no me.\nBut in a twist of fate, one day, I happened to track a group of bandits to their stronghold — an easy task, considering my experience.\nBut this time, I recognized someone among this group of bandits. Many years ago, I had once saved a youth who had lost his parents to the bandits. Though I believed that he'd come to despise the bandits even more than me, I somehow found him in cahoots with them.\nHis hair unkempt and his face filled with relief at being recognized, he knelt before me and begged for mercy, recounting all the horrors he'd seen.\nAnd even as I stood there, shocked and flabbergasted, he had stabbed me with a weapon, before melting away into the quiet night.\nHad Miss Idyia not rescued me, I'd have perhaps become yet another dry skeleton in these sands.\n\nWas there any meaning to the life I had led? Why would a victim of banditry go on to embrace their way of life?\nDeep within the Mirage, a youth shared their story against the flickering fire, their eyebrows knitted in a frown and their eyes full of tears. The lack of dignity, the agony of exile, and the loneliness in living all on one's own... Had I not harbored a burning hatred or inherited a small amount of family wealth, I would have likely become just like them.\n\"If the lid won't work, why don't we try our luck with the bottom?\" Miss Idyia's words as she struggled in vain to open a can finally allowed me to piece my thoughts together.\nThere are some evils in the world that can only be treated by removing their root causes. I know better than anyone the experiences that would drive someone to become a bandit. If I wished to stop them from going astray... I could begin by doing what I can to improve their circumstances.\nI reckon it'll be a different kind of struggle from beating someone in a fight. It's far less direct, far more difficult, and requires far more thinking, but I believe it'd also benefit those in need far more.\nAnyway, all that is to say I probably won't need this warrior's ration bag anymore.\nI will leave it here as a testament to my determination as I set off on my new journey.\n"},{"id":"Book589","title":"Book589","filename":"Book589_EN.txt","text":"O Traveler whom I've never met, if you're reading this letter now, you must be enjoying the wondrous sights of this place, just as I did in the past.

After finding myself here upon waking up, I decided to stay awhile.\nThe caretaker, Miss Idyia, appears to be struggling with the need to \"repair\" some old mechanisms on the grounds. She did not respond to my questions, but simply offered me a quiet place to stay, where I might get plenty of rest...\nNevertheless, from the way others talk about her, I could tell that she is usually a generous host. It was understandable that she would not have the time to take care of me while being pulled in several different directions.\nI was unable to get an answer from her even as I packed up and left. She did, however, give me many gifts, and invite me to try out this attraction.\nWhich is to say, I'm also quite new to this place, and don't have a lot of insights to share. I can only wish you a fun and relaxing experience.\nYou may get a slightly different experience if you were to observe the stars from here. Though the positions of the stars have not changed, their impressions on the sky appear far stronger, and it's much easier to make note of their characteristics.\nMaybe the special location and my good mood both had something to do with it?

If you look south beyond the Stone Gate you will see a Silvergrass marsh as far as the eye can see. At the southernmost point of the marsh is an inn perched atop a giant rock. That is the Wangshu Inn, the highest point on the entire marsh. Look south from there and you will see the Guili Plains. You can also make out the Guyun Stone Forest across the sea. Also — there's a weirdo staying at the inn on the top floor. I don't think I've ever heard him say a single word.\nLunch is a true feast at the Wangshu Inn. The kitchen is equipped with every utensil you could imagine — perfect for getting some practical alchemy experience.\nOn the topic of alchemy practice, I've got a few new things to test out in my search for an explosion catalyst. If everything goes smoothly, I'll spend a few more days here then head to the Guili Plains.\n\nGuili Plains\n\nIn the end, I came to the Guili Plains a few days earlier than I'd originally planned.\nRecords suggest that prior to the Archon War, this area was a thriving marketplace.\nThe foxes and wild finches are stunning here, with fur and feathers that have a certain glow about them. But I hear that they can be pests, too. Liyue locals complain that they keep eating their fruit offerings to the Geo Archon. I wonder if that gives them a fruity aroma when roasted? Maybe I should go hunting.\nThey run a strict operation at the checkpoint on the main road, but the guards who work there are friendly people. I made a potion from some local herbs and gave it to one of them for his stutter — it cured him, but it did have some minor side effects. He now can't help but constantly imitate everyone he comes across. Not just what they say, but the way they say it. It's uncanny how spot-on his impressions are.\n\nJueyun Karst\n\nI'm told that somewhere amidst the misty peaks of Jueyun Karst lives an adeptus, the exact location hidden somewhere in the ocean of cloud. All the Liyue herb gatherers claim to have seen the realm of the adepti in all its glory revealed before their very eyes in the clouds. Based on personal experience, I can say that over-indulging on certain types of mushrooms can induce visions of a similar nature.\nThe terrain here fascinates me. So many of these Stone Pillars look like they belong deep underground, not here on top of a mountain. There is supposed to be an underground reservoir here. Part of me wonders if all the water was drawn out, perhaps Jueyun Karst would find itself back on the ocean floor where it belongs.\nMy travel companion Zhongli is the sternest person I know, but he seems most entertained by this theory. He won't stop laughing.\nWhat an odd fellow.\n\nYaoguang Shoal\n\nI've heard that the fog often rolls in off the sea onto Yaoguang Shoal, and when it's at its thickest you can barely see your hand at the end of your outstretched arm. Unfortunately, I didn't make it here in time to see a foggy episode. It's a bit of a shame.\nThere are so many lovely shells on the beach. I wonder how many of them have been there since the Archon War? I strung some of them together to make a necklace, but unfortunately that fisherman from the inn sat on it and broke it... Every last shell, brutally crushed beneath his merciless buttocks. None were spared.\nNot only that, but because he injured himself on the shards of broken shell, I had to pay his medical bills.\nA giant conch shell stands on the beach where the Bishui River enters the sea. A kind old lady lives inside. Her family is said to have sailed here on the giant shell, and she spends her time rescuing shipwrecked people who end up drifting near the shore. I think that repurposing the giant shell as a self-propelled boat would make it much easier for her to rescue people from the sea.\nBut after I lost control of my third prototype seashell-boat and it blew up, the kind old lady decided she was not going to rescue me from the sea anymore.\n\nGuyun Stone Forest\n\nThis is the site where the Geo Archon defeated the sea monster. Some of the great stone spears that pierce the ocean floor still tower above the surface of the sea, though many snapped long ago. The hexagonal Stone Pillars, formed from a conglomeration of Geo energy, are quite intriguing to look at. Viewed from above, one gets the impression that they were deliberately arranged in their current form to make a specific shape on the ocean surface. Maybe that was the real reason the Geo Archon rained down destruction on the ocean floor with his stone spears? Maybe it was all just a big joke, albeit in extremely poor taste?\nZhongli from Liyue Harbor seems extremely knowledgeable on Liyue folklore, but I've never actually seen him come here. I can see the Wangshu Inn in the distance. I'll bet that weirdo I met there last time is still staring this way now.\nThe flow of the ley lines around here is unique in all of Liyue. Much more dynamic, somewhat unstable... It's as if a great, relentless power stirs somewhere in the depths of the ocean. Perhaps it is the defeated sea monster, still writhing on the ocean floor."},{"id":"Book590","title":"Book590","filename":"Book590_EN.txt","text":"Hey there, youngster... or grownup, or oldie, or whoever you are!

The envoys of the heavenly city walked the earth, and with their guidance, the people enjoyed enduring peace, prosperity, and abundance from the ancient days.\nThis Heaven-blessed reign lasted countless generations until people grew tired of their inscrutable eternity. Their offspring ceased to listen to the oracles. Instead, they desired things never promised to them by the divine, trying to break free from their fate. Enraged by their behavior, Heaven sent gigantic waves to smash the settlers' cities. A hundred days of rain came afterward, and the roaring tides drowned all sin and arrogation, and thus were the early peoples brought to an end.\nWhen the tide receded and the earth was revealed again, no cities nor civilizations now stood above the high waters. Survivors and the newborn alike lived amidst the forests and rivers, shorn of all knowledge and wisdom. Human lives were no different from those of wild animals on the earth or in the sea, driven on by the laws of nature — muddling through time with neither beginning nor end.\nUntold years passed. The throne of Gurabad was established and overturned in the far south, and the noble kindred of the east once reached the rim of the high waters — all while our ancestors remained bound by ignorance and superstition.\nCivilization and order were finally restored to the land named Fontaine the day the great king Remus descended upon Meropis in his golden Fortuna. He taught people how to farm and raise crops in the land, and built temples and cities with giant rocks to house the people. Most importantly, it was he who spread the beauty of music and art, which differentiated humans from other living things, causing them to see themselves as masters of all things.\nWith his immortal fleet, Remus conquered all the islands on the high waters. Even the great dragon beneath the abyssal depths submitted to his power. Those were the best days since the end of earliest peoples, and eternal prosperity seemed so near at hand.\nThe God King and his people indulged in the sweet dreams of carefree lives and fantasies of never-ending progress. However, the seers prophesied discord: \"The greatest empire will face the most utter destruction, and this is Fortuna.\"\nThus did the God King derive the primordial plan from the seven-day rotation and the flowing winds of sea and land, and composed a harmonious symphony of prosperity. He believed that so long as all the cities echoed with this greatest of songs, they would escape the judgment of fate and at last reach the land of eternal bliss.\nBut thusly do the ancient writers concur — \"Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change.\""},{"id":"Book641","title":"Book641","filename":"Book641_EN.txt","text":"Greatness and glory unto Remuria, and its immortal ruler, Remus, king of all under heaven and universal Harmost. Today, the glamor and luxury of the bygone Eternal City is beyond the imagination of even the most knowledgeable scholars.\nAs you sailed past the Ocean Pillars along the royal fairway to the giant port playing host to Fortuna the imperial ship, you would have first seen a lofty tower. The tower of Remuria was not built to receive heavenly oracles, but to guide ships traveling between islands in the high waters. It is said that the tower stood at the border of reality and dreams. Even if sailors were to be lured into slumber by sirens, they could follow the sound of the bell to break through the mist and find their way to Remuria.\nContinuing along the royal fairway leading to Machimos, where the brave Remurian warriors lived. The grand temples and arenas were built with giant carved rocks to commemorate the city's glory and victory. The solid and towering walls are decorated with glaze and gold, bronze and marble statues arrayed the land, and gold, spices and specialties from the world over piled up in the markets.\nTraveling through Machimos, you would arrive at Capitolium, the center of Remuria, overflowing with delightful aromas and beautiful melodies. It was a paradise for artists, where only the most outstanding intellectuals and musicians were allowed. Even among them, however, only a small fraction enjoyed the privilege of serving the God King. Here, all the theaters and palaces were established in shapes most harmonious, their beams and domes adorned with the most sumptuous and intricate carvings, and centered on a golden palace of towering copper pillars. The King, resting peacefully at the heart of the palace, listened closely to every melody and every note coming from every corner of the empire. Upon hearing any discord, the God King would correct it immediately with a pluck of his strings, bringing perfection to the symphony of his empire.\nTo keep all the people upon the high water from destroying the symphony of universal harmony, King Remus promoted four humans of great capability to high post. He shared his power and authority with them, making them his partners in governance, the Harmosts for all cities, to eliminate all discordant sounds.\nTo spread the harmonious symphony throughout the world, he built far-reaching fairways, which conveyed the melodies as never-ending ripples from Capitolium to every corner that sat above the high waters.\nYet fate's decree was not for even such as gods to defy, and to even attempt to escape destined judgment was a mortal sin. Amongst the God King's sins, the most terrible was the attempt to pass power that should have been reserved for the godly domain to humans. Thus, this power and status led to corruption and decadence, leading to violence and revolts.\nSuch is fate's cunning that it uses the very powers that rebel against it to its own ends. When the day of destiny arrived, Remuria, the grand immortal city, faced an inevitable end. Today, the God King's melody is played only in Capitolium, and his mighty reign has ended.\nThusly do the ancient writers concur — \"Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change.\""},{"id":"Book642","title":"Book642","filename":"Book642_EN.txt","text":"Humans, in their naivete, once believed that the reign of the King Remus and his Eternal City would surpass time and fate to last thousands of years, just like the giant rocks comprising the ringed ritual sites.\nUntil that day, when the earth collapsed all at once, the tall tower was uprooted, and drowned in the titanic waves alongside the great hall of pillars. Until that day, when the royal fairways and temples were reduced to ruins, and the city, along with its residents, warriors, intellectuals, nobles, and even the golden palace, as glamorous as the shining sun, fell into a chasm of eternal darkness.\nThat was the moment when the absurdity of their \"eternity\" finally dawned on them.\nGlory to our Noble Navigator, the Ruler of Rivers and Seas, and the Queen of All Waters. May she defend the law, and may her reign be long. Peace be upon all the realms of Fontaine, and all the people under the heavens. When the royal city collapsed, the great power shattered, and the people above the high water were perched on the precipice of barbarism and annihilation, it was our noble Queen who settled the conflicts between the tribes. Around the flowing springs we established cities new, and started a world guided by laws that has endured to this day.\nThe tragedy of Remuria occurred merely a century ago, but its history has already become concealed in legends and superstitions. This does partly come down to the fatal catastrophe that destroyed it — so ruthless and swift was the disaster that all the researchers and literature capable of passing down said knowledge now sleep beneath the waters with the Eternal City. Another key reason is the purposeful distortions created by the mysterious researchers who claimed to be descendants of Remuria. My job is to extract and reproduce the true, essential shape of this magnificent ancient civilization with the universal rationality of history.\nIn certain folklore that exists today, even the greatest of ancient scholars have been painted as soul-stealing magisters who entrapped mortal spirits within specially-made magical golems, binding them into service. To be sure, the Remurians did make such terrifying golems, which to this day may be found, ruined, out in the wild. But this may only be blamed upon the moral degeneration that came upon them in Remuria's latter days. Its people had forsaken their noble duties and embraced hedonism and debauchery, accepting the violence they inflicted on others — and thus were they also violently destroyed.\nJust as the ancient writers concur — \"Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change.\""},{"id":"Book643","title":"Book643","filename":"Book643_EN.txt","text":"The Maiden and the Sun\n\nThe adopted daughter of the fox grew to be of marriageable age, her face as gentle as a beautiful spring.\nDelicate and polite was she, and none could name a lady better.\n\nTherefore, the fox said to her daughter,\n\"My girl, little girl, I am standing in my grave.

That is where the penguins live.\nPenguins are chubby little ladies and gentlemen, with tuxedos of black feathers pulled tight over their cute white bellies. You might think they look awkward on land, waddling about, unable to fly like other birds. But just you wait. You'll see them throw themselves onto those bellies and slide as if snowboarding, right into the water. With a splash, they become elegant and talented swimmers, their thick, flipper-like wings helping to streamline their bodies as they zoom about underwater.\nNow, lots of children already know these penguin facts. And children who love penguins will know all this by heart.\nBut there is one thing that even the penguin-loving children don't know. Every penguin in the world comes from outer space, far beyond the skies. Great flocks of penguins once flew across the universe, their flippers steering them between the stars, their sleek feathers reflecting what little starlight there was out there in the void. From red giants to white dwarfs, from the shoulder of Orion to the glimmering Tannhauser Gate... The penguins explored it all. The penguins remember it all.\nBut, perhaps because of some interstellar catastrophe or even a simple family argument, several penguin clans split off from that galaxy-roaming flock and landed in the icy waters to the south of Teyvat. They became our first penguins. But those new arrivals found our atmosphere too thick to fly in, and their lack of prior experience with water left them unable to swim as well. Until, that is, the birth of the marvelous Pers the Penguin — the first penguin to learn to swim.\n\nLike many young penguins, Pers would gaze up at the starry night sky, or the blue skies of daytime, and say to himself: \"If only I could fly, like my ancestors!\"\n\nAnd so Pers decided to learn from the birds. How did they fly so high?\nFirst, Pers the Penguin asked the biggest bird he could find: a frigatebird. And the frigatebird said: \"Haha! Piece of cake! Once you bring me 30 fish, I'll spill the beans!\"\nAnd so Pers spent 50 nights on a moonlit beach, collecting 300 shells. Then he found a whale who liked shells and exchanged his 300 shells for 30 fish.\nThe next day, the frigatebird swallowed those 30 fish in one great big gulp before laughing and flying away. As he flew off, he called down to young Pers: \"The secret to flying is to be light! Why not try losing some weight?\"\nWell, losing weight was easy enough. But if a penguin lost its thick layer of fat, it wouldn't be a penguin anymore. So, Pers shook his head.\nAnd as all children know, the frigatebird got a new nickname after all this for its greed and unreasonable nature: the piratebird.\n\nNext, Pers asked the seagulls for help. But all they did was squawk and croak. Pers was thus none the wiser, and the seagulls wound up having a big argument. In fact, some of them became so angry that they refused to fly ever again, becoming auks... Though that's a different story.\nAnd so Pers asked a petrel for help. But the petrel would only teach him some impractical tricks, and not the basics that he needed most. Because, that noble seabird thought, surely it was better to learn how to soar through a stormy sky than to worry about trivial matters like taking off and landing.\n\nPers was now a very disappointed penguin. He waddled back to the beach and gazed out across the peaceful nighttime ocean. And as he did so, he noticed for the first time ever that the stars of his celestial homeland were reflected in the ocean. And he found them so beautiful that he simply... jumped in.\nAnd, after a brief moment of panicked sinking, Pers the Penguin realized that he could fly — underwater, at least. He could whizz speedily along, or twist and turn. It was, after all, what those strong wings and that smooth round body had been made for!\nAnd that is how Pers the Penguin became the first penguin to learn to swim. And after Pers, many other penguins plucked up the courage to take that leap into the waters and, like their ancestors, soar amongst the glimmering stars, exploring, feeding, and playing.\nOnce Pers had shown them the way, the penguins took to life in the water and forgot their spacefaring past. Not even in their dreams did they remember that limitless void. The penguins live here now, between sea and land."},{"id":"Book656","title":"Book656","filename":"Book656_EN.txt","text":"Princess Marcotte\n\nIn the not-too-distant past, every type of plant and every type of beast had its own kingdom.\nAnd in the Marcotte Kingdom, there live a princess with long pink hair. Legend has it that she was born in a crab claw and never put down roots — she always was, and always would be, a tough little seed.\n\"My darling daughter, my beloved treasure. Why not settle down and enjoy a life of nobility? Why do you wait so long to sprout and grow?\" asked her worried and kingly father.\n\"Father, father, please do not fret or rage. I was born in a crab claw, and that claw will be my ship. Your daughter's fate is not to take root in the mundane earth and grow pretty flowers. It is to conquer the seas and explore a new and wonderful world!\"\nThe king was shocked by his daughter's plans. What was wrong with pretty flowers, he thought? Wasn't he a pretty flower? And what if his daughter one day decided to set down those roots and grow an even prettier garland than his? That would be terrible.\nBut he only felt this way because he was ashamed of not being as pretty as he wanted to be.\n\nAnd so, he had the princess and the crab claw locked up in a golden box. Then he hid the golden box in a mirror made of purest water. And then he threw the mirror into the sapphire lake of the Pluie Lotus Kingdom. There was only one way to reverse all those layers of confinement and free the princess (and the crab claw) — to make the Mother Lotus laugh. And as everyone knows, Pluie Lotuses are all too used to weeping.\n\n\"All is well again,\" said the king. \"I can rest my regal head in peace. All I need to do is wait and wait, for my beloved daughter's seed to start to crack. She will lose her wanderlust. For what choice will she have, but to grow...\"\n\n\"And then my daughter will be like me. She will follow her destiny and grow strong and healthy.\"\n\nBut the brave princess was not cowed by her long imprisonment. She wrote joke after joke to try and make the Mother Lotus laugh, and practiced telling those jokes over and over. The crab claw chortled. Even the golden box guffawed. But the Mother Lotus? Nothing.\nSo she decided to write a comic play. She rehearsed until the crab claw couldn't help but burst into laughter and hop around — despite having no feet! She even converted the interior of the box into a theater. But still, nothing.\nNext, the princess tried to find comedy in the circumstances of her imprisonment — situational comedy, she called it. Soon the crab claw was, like the princess, laughing until it cried and then crying until it laughed. And eventually, the Pluie Lotus — keen criers, as we know — found themselves giggling. Finally, the Mother Lotus could contain her curiosity no longer, and the princess was granted an audience.\nAnd, to everyone's surprise, the princess didn't even need to tell a single joke. The Mother Lotus burst out laughing as soon as the princess entered the room. Her laughter grew louder and louder, shaking the palace walls and sending ripples across the sapphire lake.\nPrincess Marcotte won her freedom. But she won something more valuable as well — the ability to laugh, and to make others laugh, even in the saddest of circumstances.\nIn her crab claw ship, the princess sailed the ocean waves on her voyage to the new world of her dreams. And ever since, sailors have told tales of a crab claw ship."},{"id":"Book657","title":"Book657","filename":"Book657_EN.txt","text":"Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman\n\nA long, long time ago, Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman were good friends.\nMr. Fox was a successful thief. The Clockwork Guardsman was... well, he was a guard. Clue's in the name, isn't it?\nBut that was a long, long time ago, of course. They're still good friends, though. That will never change, no matter their jobs or social status.\nThe Clockwork Guardsman had always had a worry curled up inside him, and as the years passed and his mechanisms aged, that worry got bigger and bigger, like a balloon, and heavier and heavier, like a piglet, and it was always there no matter how much he tried to shake it off, like Mr. Fox's lovely tail. It was a very worrying worry.\n\nSo the Clockwork Guardsman told his good friend, Mr. Fox, of this concerning concern: \"I've already lived a very long time. I've met so many people and said goodbye to so many. I've heard the funniest jokes and lived through the saddest times, and then I've forgotten it all and lived through it again. Even though forgetting isn't easy for a machine such as myself, it all fades.\"\nMr. Fox understood his friend's concerns and knew just what to suggest: \"If living such a long life makes you forgetful and jaded, perhaps it is time to die, and in doing so, to make your life real.\"\n\"But, my fluffiest of friends,\" the Clockwork Guard said, removing his alloy guard's cap and sighing, \"didn't you steal Death from Ms. Toad's dressing table in that heist many years ago? It caused quite the commotion, as I recall. The living things of the world all forgot how to die.\"\nAs, we all know, Ms. Toad is Death's envoy, the queen of all that is ugly, cold, and annoying. She guards that coldest jewel, Death itself.\n\n\"Ah, I was so young then. I remember I was madly in love with Ms. Jackal, and I wanted to bring her the most expensive treasure I could find.\"\n\"And?\"\n\"I succeeded. But she died.\"\nDeath slipped from Ms. Jackal's hand and shattered on the ground. The fragments melted into the earth, never to be seen again. And as that happened, the creatures of the world started to die as normal once more, with all that should have been dead now being so. Except, that is, for Mr. Fox, who should have died, but didn't. His life dragged on.\n\n\"Death still exists in this world! All we need do is search for it!\" And so Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman, furry paw in cold metal hand, left the city they called home to search for Death in all the corners of the world.\nAnd they searched and they searched and then they searched some more. They searched until Mr. Fox's beautiful red coat had turned white. They searched until the Clockwork Guardsman's pride and joy, his official guard badge, had rusted. Finally, they reached the place where Ms. Toad lived.\n\n\"Ms. Toad? Ms. Toad?\" called the Guardsman, as he knocked on the door.\nMs. Toad opened the door slowly and stretched out her warty, scabby hand.\n\"Lovely Ms. Toad, I am so sorry to bother you again,\" said Mr. Fox as he took off his hat. \"But my good friend is in great pain, and you are the keeper of the only cure.\"\n\"Ms. Toad is of course aware of how lovely she is,\" came a rasping voice from within the ramshackle hut. \"And if your friend seeks Death, he will not find it here.\"\n\"Life is not tea and Death is not sugar. Their tastes cannot be distinguished if you live forever. But you have a mechanical heart and a mechanical tongue, and have tasted their flavor over and over, during each cycle of activation and deactivation...\" Ms. Toad removed an embroidered shroud to reveal the cold jewel called Death, then extended a hand, beckoning to the Clockwork Guardsman. \"Come, young guard, come, child. All must be tested, but do not admit defeat easily, my strong child...\"\n\"My maggots will not eat you, my moss will not grow on you. Whether your enemy is time or guilt, sadness or ennui... Do not admit defeat easily, my child.\"\nAnd with that, Ms. Toad took the guard's metal hand and placed it lightly on the jewel called Death, and he saw how long, long in the future, he would end—\nAfter countless years of hardships, a battered and beaten Clockwork Guardsman was thrown into the fires of the scrapping plant, to melt into a metallic ocean of millennia of waste. All those slow metal thoughts and hard metal ideas became swift and liquid. They evolved and combined and formed a new life. It was a glorious return for all metal lifeforms, making even the release of death fade in comparison.\n\nAnd so the Clockwork Guardsman saw the future and gave up his dreams of dying. His good friend Mr. Fox, meanwhile, withdrew his thieving hand and left the jewel where it was. Indeed, life encompasses more than just bitterness akin to tea. If he had a friend to accompany him through the hard times, what rush was there? He could steal this extraordinary jewel later.\n\nLater, as all children know, Mr. Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman lived long, long lives, until the little world they lived in was but a desert, until the sun went out, until the moon fell... And even then, their story didn't end. It lived on, passed from world to world."},{"id":"Book658","title":"Book658","filename":"Book658_EN.txt","text":"...\nAn old man with gray hair carefully stood six special musket rounds on the table, looking at the brother and sister before him with his nearly blind eyes.\n\"Six bullets.

After the decline of the Guhua Clan and the death of the Master, the boy and an elderly caretaker were the sole remaining disciples at the school. But the boy didn't give up, mastering all the esoteric techniques and reading every last book hidden there. Running the school single-handedly as the previous master had before him, the young man defeated countless challengers with neither Vision nor arcane weapon... He also took a young girl from Inazuma as his student.\nWhen tumultuous times beset the world, and the girl from Inazuma left without saying goodbye, the young man decided it was time for him to explore the world beyond the mountain — starting, of course, with the distant land of Inazuma..."},{"id":"Book660","title":"Book660","filename":"Book660_EN.txt","text":"Number 65, Ooze Avenue. The wooden door to a tavern in a cranny of this city of sin was kicked open with a bang.\nThe loud chatter stopped, and patrons put their drinks down to look at the uninvited guest in the pouring rain.\nThe muscular man was dressed in black from head to toe. If it weren't for the candles in the tavern, one would think that it was the heavy darkness of the night that had forced the door open.\nThe intruder turned slightly. The brim of his hat covered most of his face, showing only his sharp chin. He looked around, almost as if wondering why he was here. From his relaxed posture and relieved breathing, patrons could speculate that he had either accomplished something very important, or just carried out some revenge...\nAnd, at that moment, he just wanted a drink.\nHe walked toward the bar, and the raindrops on his coat followed him like loyal spirits. His boots thudded with every heavy step taken, leaden with unbelievable, crushing conviction.\n\"Give me something strong,\" said he, with a voice low enough to shatter wine bottles.\nThe owner poured him a glass reluctantly, then looked at the door and wondered how long it would take him to wipe the boot-print off.\n\"Thank you,\" said the man, \"I just accomplished something great alongside my sister.\"\n\"Well, where is she?\" The owner asked, deciding to make some small talk.\n\"She went to plant flowers. I gave her all my money because she's always wanted to do that.\"\n\"How will you pay for your drink, then?\"\nThe man seemed taken by surprise, as if he had never considered it.\n\"Guess I'll pay with this.\"\nThe man tossed a black musket onto the bartop with a thud.\nThe patrons next to him spilled their drinks in terror. Everyone held their breath.\n\"I'm not taking that.\"\nThe owner feigned calm as he replied, but quietly, he reached into the drawer under the bar, where he hid a pistolet. He wasn't sure if he could fire faster than the man in front of him, though.\n\"Don't worry, it just fired its last and most important shot, and it will never be used again.\" The explanation done, the man downed another drink.\nThe owner caught a glimpse of the man's face when he raised his head. It was a handsome face, with a high nose, some scars, and sad black eyes.\nThe owner withdrew his hand from the drawer. This man wasn't here to cause a scene. It was almost as if he had been drunk even before entering the tavern.\n\"May I have another?\" the man asked.\n\"You've had enough,\" replied the owner.\n\"I know, but tonight was special.\" He didn't notice that the owner was trying to get him to leave.\n\"How so?\"\n\"I just killed someone.\"\nThe owner's hands froze. Coming from this man, it didn't sound like a joke.\n\"It was revenge,\" added the man. \"He killed my mother.\"\n\"And who was 'he'?\"\n\"The Baron.\"\n\"Nonsense.\" Now the owner was certain that the man was drunk.\nEveryone knew that the Baron was bad news. Many wanted to kill him, but none dared to risk their lives to try.\n\"I suppose you could have missed the gunshot if your farts were loud enough,\" the man taunted.\nThe owner looked at the man again. He had large hands and a muscular build. He seemed to have been through countless fights — no tavern scuffles these, but real fights that had put his life on the line.\nSomething flashed across the owner's mind. He recalled the recent series of musket murders, where the killer always left a Rainbow Rose and struck on stormy nights...\n\"No way... Are you...\"\nBefore the owner could finish, lightning struck beyond the wooden door, and a wild gale threw it open. Night flooded in, drowning the patrons like a tidal wave.\nWhen the candles were lit again, the man was gone, but he had left his musket behind. It stared everyone down in silence like some solemn god of death, staring into the night that belonged to it...\n\n—The Two Musketeers, Fin."},{"id":"Book661","title":"Book661","filename":"Book661_EN.txt","text":"This is a story from many years ago. After the evening banquet, Ms. Aviva (who today would be Lady Nenonen) was, as always, theatrically grousing to us about the all-too-swift march of science. Though her grasp on engineering is even less firm than her knowledge of Watatsumi Island's soil quality (and of course, she knows nothing about the latter either), but self-proclaimed interest in engineering was in vogue amongst some ladies and gentlemen at the time.\n\n\"Our ancestors had already conquered this land thousands of years ago,\" she said as she cleared her throat, twirling her jade-plumed and blue-gem-encrusted folding fan while endeavoring in vain to wear a visage of despondency. \"And a few hundred years ago, they conquered the oceans with ease using new diving equipment. Today, some noble young folk have suddenly got it in their heads to use a so-termed gravimeter to break free from the earth's shackles and conquer the skies — and surely, I fear, their dream may yet become reality in the near future.\"\n\n\"Indeed, it is just as you say. Humans — ah, what a mighty and energetic species, with such great wisdom! No matter the circumstances, humans ever seek to change their living conditions with unimaginable passion,\" The Steambird editor immediately opined. \"In truth, when it comes to mechanical engineering and theory, humanity is already on par with the creator. They have conquered most of the natural world, and by their will, they can shape this world anew.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's... not what I meant to say,\" Ms. Aviva said with an affected sigh. \"Those distant and dark unknown continents, those ruins hidden deep beneath the seas, all that romantic exploration and trailblazing — such great achievements, that which has put the glorious achievements of our sciences and reasoning on full display — have all but become lost to our civilization. Our forebears reached too high and achieved too much, leaving too little for us to explore or conquer. Could there be a sadder fate to befall those ladies and gentlemen amongst us who were born to crave the exploration of the unknown?\"\n\nHere, her pretentious invocation of the legendary King Argeadai's words seemed an attempt to prove how truly this state of affairs hurt her. However, everyone simply sat around lazily, at most giving polite nods. Lady Elle lightly yawned.\n\nSeeing how no one answered, Ms. Aviva's enthusiasm faded and she proceeded to switch the topic to next week's ball. This was, evidently, a more popular topic, and the stiff atmosphere once again grew lively. Monsieur Ratar was just about to regale us with a tale he had heard in Sumeru regarding a tower, a mage, and a glass ball, but before he could begin, Mr. Ciric, who had remained silent till now, interrupted.\n\n\"Good Ms. Aviva, the things you said certainly left an impression on me.\" He lit a cigarette. \"However, you need not worry. There is still one space that has yet to be subdued by humanity — indeed, if the required techniques do not emerge, I fear it will never be.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\" Ratar asked, a sullen look on his face. He had been so very confident about his monkey story, after all.\n\n\"Time.\"\n\nThe room fell silent momentarily before all present broke out into laughter.\n\n\"What preposterous talk!\" Dr. Reinier declared, trying not to laugh. \"Firstly, how can time be considered a part of space?\"\n\n\"Can you separate yourself from time and exist independently in space alone?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean to, at this moment, still be speaking to me, and in the next disappear without a trace. Is this possible?\" He waited for a moment, as if waiting for the others to think. \"Obviously, anyone with the capacity for rigorous thought would know for certain that much like length, width, and height, time is also a dimension of space. As such, it is a part of nature, and can thus be conquered.\"\n\n\"Utterly preposterous...\" The doctor muttered, but did not refute the statement.\n\n\"I have been involved in research of this sort for some time,\" he continued, \"and I have come up with a machine that can allow people to travel through time as they please. This machine will be ready in two months. At that time, Ms. Aviva, I invite you and all the ladies and gentlemen present here to my workshop, to bear witness to humanity's next great achievement: the conquest of time.\"\n\nMs. Aviva did not speak. In fact, from her expression, our noble friend did not understand Mr. Ciric's words at all."},{"id":"Book662","title":"Book662","filename":"Book662_EN.txt","text":"Two months later, we — The Steambird editor, the doctor, Mr. Revilo Oliver, and others who had attended that evening banquet — came to Ciric's workshop as agreed. Ms. Aviva was not there, for she never had much interest in such things, but instead found more meaning in attending a social ball at Salon Caritat.\n\nSurprisingly, Ciric had grown older and more frail in just two months. In the dim light of the lamp, his once enthusiastic, arrogant expression had hardened into something indifferent and solemn, almost like the emaciated ascetics of Sumeru.\n\nHe welcomed us to take our seats, speaking in a calm tone.\n\n\"Well then, how is your plan to conquer time progressing?\" The Steambird editor asked directly. \"Where is the time machine you spoke of?\"\n\nCiric did not reply. Instead, he pointed to the desk next to him. Our gazes followed, and in the middle of that table was a gold-plated whale-shaped model airship about the size of a small clock. Even a non-professional eye could readily discern that the model was of exquisite craftsmanship. Beneath its clear crystal shell, an indistinguishable and formless color flowed ever so slowly, glowing faintly in the lampshade's shadow.\n\n\"So,\" the doctor said, \"it took you two months to make this little toy that would amaze even Lepaute's artisans?\"\n\n\"It certainly looks like nothing special,\" Ciric said, an inscrutable emotion shining in his eyes that could almost be called pity, \"But this is simply a projection the object has left in this moment, just as one can only see a thin line when viewing paper from the side.\"\n\n\"Blithering nonsense.\"\n\nFor some reason, Ciric did not refute that statement, merely asking us in a calm tone to hear him out concerning his time travel experiences. We agreed, and so he began to tell the story I shall now relate below, without interruption from beginning to end.\n\nFor all of you, it was two months ago when I first told you of the idea of a time machine. Similarly, it must have been a week ago when I finished constructing said device and stepped into it, initiating the very first instance of time travel in human history.\n\nThe strange sensations that came over me as I traveled through time are beyond words, just as there are no words with which one can impress the stars' brightness upon a blind person. About twenty minutes after this — though describing time travel by using subjective time is quite meaningless — the machine ceased operation. I looked about me then, and realized that I was in a Remurian imperial settlement. The grand temples and arenas carved of titanic stone would make the Opera Epiclese hang its head in shame, while the creations of Alain Guillotin would be little more than a child's wind-up toy before the towering Remurian golems. Just as I was beside myself in awe, a few patrolling troops discovered me. Seeing my strange style of dress, they took me to be a spy for the barbarian tribes. They seized me, naming me a lowly slave, a degenerate believer in a false god, and threatened to throw me into a deep cistern to feed the vipers.\n\nFortunately, the local Aedile — I later found out that her name was Aidia Anavana — realized that my identity was anything but ordinary, and had me sent before her. She endured my calamitous grammar and catastrophic accent (at that time, I could not even pronounce \"Remuria,\" with it coming out something more akin to \"Emuia\") while asking me many questions, which I answered truthfully. Quickly, she accepted the fact that I was from the future and showed me a stone slate that the slaves had recently dug up."},{"id":"Book663","title":"Book663","filename":"Book663_EN.txt","text":"The slate was a perfect square, each line and column engraved with seven symmetrical sequences of symbols — these were not in Remurian script, but rather the characters we use today. Regardless of the manner in which the text was read, or the order, or direction, the information within the text did not change — it was an elaborate riddle involving dogs, pastures, cyan finches, the summer rains, the song of the roses, a Rishboland Tiger's stripes, and the ordered patterns of rocks. Despite my long-time love of wordplay games, this endless cycle of riddles made me terribly dizzy. For some reason, I knew that I must solve it, no matter the price. I spent half a year doing so alongside Aidia — and as it turned out, the key to deciphering it lay with the name of a slave now thirty years dead, while the answer was a date, set several hundred years after the empire's fall.\n\nI bade Aidia farewell and stepped back upon the time machine, forwarding myself to that date in hopes of finding the secret behind that stone slate. There, I met several Marechaussee Hunters, and they showed me another stone slate, which again had 49 mirrored characters on it that formed another riddle. Again, the answer was a date, one set in a future still further off.\n\nFollowing these stone slates' directions, I cris-crossed the fabric of past and future, shuttling back and forth 13 times. Each stone slate's riddle was trickier than the last. One of them could only be cracked using a bad romance novel that would only be published 300 years hence — the 5th word of the 37th page of that book would form a conjugate with the full name of the 375th Maison Gardiennage officer from 375 years ago. Another riddle's cipher was based on a white flower that will only bloom several millennia in the future — I know not its name, and its pistil structure is very strange indeed. It might be a mallow of some sort, but I cannot be sure. That flower is nourished by skylark calls, and so one of the clues to its cipher was the number of ribs on a skylark during Remurian times. I suppose that is, generally speaking, just how the riddles worked.\n\nThe final stone slate came from the underground storeroom of the Basil Elton Memorial Museum, and had naught but one number on it: \"0.\"\n\nI do not know what I was thinking at the moment. After all, setting my destination to \"0\" is an action utterly devoid of meaning. But I punched the number into my machine all the same and pulled the control lever. After who knows how long, the machine stopped. I sensed that I was floating atop a sea with no waves or tides, for even the wind did not exist at that moment. The sky that loomed overhead was not blue, but a dark red adorned with countless stars, pale and distant, like salt frost lining the shore.\n\nI stared at this very first of oceans, transfixed, and several minutes passed before I realized that there was something shadowy hidden beneath the placid surface. It was the Palais Mermonia, which should not be there.\n\nAt that moment, I could hear someone call me by name — Neven Ciric, the voice called. I turned, and it was like looking into a mirror. A man, identical to myself, looking me dead in the eye, just as I did to him.\n\n\"Neven Ciric,\" he continued, \"you wish to conquer time. No one can do that.\"\n\n\"It was you who left those riddles behind?\"\n\n\"It was you who left those riddles behind.\" He repeated my question as if it was an answer. \"Those riddles are part of time, and every matching symbol is time itself.\"\n\n\"So, the final answer to the riddle of time is zero.\"\n\n\"Zero is not an answer. Instead, it is another mystery, for the answer cannot be found in the riddle,\" he said. \"The answer to time's riddle is a mirror — or perhaps I should say that this is the answer that is simplest to comprehend. When two mirrors face each other, time is the infinite reflection of light therein. Countless diverging, converging, and parallel lights form the illusion we call time. There is no past or future, for the past is the future. As you stand here at Moment Zero and look forward along the gap between the two mirrors, all beams of light fall along the same plane, and not one may escape. The Palais Mermonia had already sunk long before it was ever built, and the sunken Palais will be raised anew. Joy, sorrow, tears, and death must infinitely recur, for this is the nature of a mirror. Similarly, you can never conquer time, just as you can never grasp your shadow in your hand.\"\n\nPerhaps it was horror or momentary frenzy, but when he finished, I whipped out the firearm I kept for self-defense, leveled it at his head, and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe room was silent.\n\n\"I do not expect you to believe me,\" Ciric said as he stood up, his eyes sweeping the room. \"Just take it as a bunch of bunk that I made up to cover up for my inability to make a time machine. Make of it some lame tale, a dream born purely of delusion. In any case, ladies and gentlemen, I shall take my leave of you — my future self awaits a riddle that I must set him.\"\n\nI never saw Ciric Neven again."},{"id":"Book664","title":"Book664","filename":"Book664_EN.txt","text":"People often say I've got a good head for business, that I'm good at spotting and taking advantage of opportunities. Personally, I don't think of it like that. I think we make our own opportunities. I started from nothing, with not a Mora to my name. I had nothing to rely on but myself, my ability to negotiate and persuade those better off to work with me. That's how I created my opportunities — through negotiation.\nAnd all my experiences have taught me that the ability to negotiate can solve almost any problem. That's what I've always counted on. So I hope you won't follow the path I describe, as that would only make the world more difficult for me to succeed in.\n...\n\n\"Gain the Initiative\"\nI think the outcome of most negotiations can be determined from the outset. Everyone who knows me knows that. I used to be an itinerant desert trader, which is how I got my start. I had no money, no experience. But I learned something very important out there: \"Always speak loudly to make people think you are confident.\"\nThe desert is hostile to outsiders. The locals there will only deal with those they trust. They are scared of outsiders, or rather maybe they're scared of being cheated. So why would they trade with me, some penniless kid with no background? But later I realized that their rejection of outsiders was only a symptom. So what was the underlying cause? It's because they can't be sure of the quality of products that come from outside.\nSo obviously, you need to provide compelling proof of the quality of your goods to win their trust. Or make them think you have that compelling proof, at least. Now, how do you do make them think that? It's all in how confidently you talk, even if it's just bravado. As long as you act confident, people will assume you have a reason for that confidence, and they'll talk themselves into trusting you.\nSo I hawked my goods loud and proud. I used my imposing manner to overpower them, beating them down until they started to wonder why I dared talk like that. Well, it had to be because I had plenty of buyers and I didn't care if they made a purchase or not, right? Which meant I had to have a good reputation for selling quality goods. That meant they couldn't go wrong buying them.\nAnd you all know what happened next. I made my first fortune.\nLooking back, I feel that negotiation is all about convincing the other party to agree with or accept whatever you're telling them. If you gain the initiative by showing your strength and overwhelm your opponent with an imposing manner, they'll be convinced. And that brings our goals within easy reach, doesn't it?\n...\n\n\"Steer the Conversation\"\nI find steering conversation to be a very effective negotiation technique and a reliable way of getting out of a difficult situation.\nI once wanted to try to sell goods from Mondstadt in Liyue. But my customers didn't know anything about Mondstadt. They were just ordinary folk who'd never set foot outside Liyue in their lives. For them, buying goods from some unknown place was a huge risk, so sales were understandably poor. And as you can imagine, my investor was losing faith.\nNow that might sound like a thorny problem, but the solution was simple. I had to talk to my customers about what a great place Mondstadt is, making them curious about it, or even trusting. And that trust would transfer to my goods and convert into sales. And what about my investor? That was even easier. He lacked faith, so I gave him some. I convinced him sales would be good. And of course, it doesn't really matter if sales really are good or not.\nOnce you identify the root cause of a problem, the solution will become apparent. But I couldn't be too obvious about it. I carried out a market research survey, with a Mora reward for anyone who filled in a questionnaire. Everyone was clamoring to fill one in once they heard the sound of Mora.\nNow, you might be wondering what this has got to do with negotiation. I can answer that: The most powerful weapon in a negotiation is the truth, and the truth can be manipulated. The questionnaire looked like market research, but it was actually guiding everyone toward the conclusion I wanted them to reach.\n\nSo here's what happened. I planted some leading questions in the survey. For example, I felt Mondstadt is known for its freedom, while Liyue's citizens largely desire leisurely and happy lives. Thus, the conclusion I wanted people to reach was that those two things are mutually complementary.\nSo I asked questions like this:\nDo you like a relaxed and leisurely life? Do you like an atmosphere of freedom? Do fine wines help you enjoy life? And so on.\nMost people would answer such questions in the affirmative. Next, we used the survey to ask if they like free and happy cities, such as the city of Mondstadt. And, naturally, most people answered yes. With that, we created the impression that everyone in Mondstadt is happy.\nThat gave me an image to leverage in my sales. I wasn't selling goods now, I was selling a lifestyle, a lifestyle of happiness — and obviously, you can all imagine how successful I was.\nOf course, you will always run into contrary types who insist on singing a different tune. Those responses can influence the data from the survey and cause undue concern to the people who see those numbers — my investor, for example.\nI had to eliminate that, or at least reduce it. And I did so in a rather crude way. I hinted to the participants that the Mora reward would be dependent on their answers. Money is enough of a temptation to convince most of the contrary types to compromise. That meant I had cleaner data, which I could use to bolster my investor's faith. And that meant it was time for the next part of my plan.\n...\n\n\"The Universal Formula\"\nPeople often ask me if there are any unbeatable negotiation techniques that can be used in any situation. I tell them there is one. It is to begin your answers like this: \"I agree with your views, but...\" I call this the \"universal formula\" for no other reason than that it analyzes and uses human nature. It lays bare our weaknesses.\nWhy? Because we crave approval. Nobody can do without it, myself included. I used to be an itinerant trader, traveling all over. I met all kinds of people back then. The Eremites, Treasure Hoarders, and even the Abyss Order. All of them, even the Abyss Mages, known for their stubbornness and mischief-making, would reconsider their views and seek my approval after I used that line.\nI would even dare to say that if I could speak the language of Slimes or Hilichurls, they too would fall under the spell of that magic trick. So I would hate for everyone to know it, especially my competitors.\n..."},{"id":"Book665","title":"Book665","filename":"Book665_EN.txt","text":"To my love, my dearest Monsieur Neuvillette,\nI know not how many days and nights have passed since our previous trial.

If only my family had enough money for a Kamera and things didn't go wrong, I'm sure my mom would have taken lots of photos of me... Rene and Jakob like Alain's sister a lot, too. When the four of them hang out, she sometimes acts like an older sister to them, despite being the youngest, it's a really interesting dynamic...\n...Seem to be interested in the ruins and the stone statues here. Rene also mentioned something about a troupe and seals... Even though we went out there to have a bit of fun for once, they were still thinking about research...\nNo obvious symptoms.\n\n...\nTook the day off.\n\n...\n...Alain's sister came to see me with Jakob. Alain and Rene couldn't make it, because their experiment is at a critical stage. They didn't have to tell me any of that though, after all, with my limited abilities, that I was able to help at all is already fulfilling!\n\n...\nI heard that Alain and the Institute's director came to see me (separately)! while I was unconscious. I feel bad that they came all this way for nothing, I wasn't even awake...\nStill taking time off, but I hope to go back and help them again soon.\n\n...\n...I found out that they were graduates from the Narzissenkreuz Institute, and that made me really happy. They talked about the director and the vice director, as well as their adventures, and it made me feel like a kid again. The only detail that didn't make sense was the cake the vice director made, because it felt like punishment when we had it...\n...After the disaster, I lost contact with pretty much all my friends. I'm so happy that they were able to find each other again. I wonder how my friends are doing. They're probably trying to rebuild the Narzissenkreuz Institute! Next time I'll go check it out...\n...Talked about the thinking machine again. I had an idea about making a thinking Kamera, so that it would take photos of those precious to him while he's busy. He thought it was kind of pointless, but that it had security and surveillance applications...\n\n...\n...They did it! The light bulb came on! I was lucky to have recovered in time to witness this historical moment... It's quite a pity, but I hope Rene and Jakob will make the breakthroughs of their own in their own research topics! Ah, I also hope they get better assistants than me!\nNo clear symptoms.\n\n...\nTook the day off.\n\n...\nThere were several visits while I was unconscious. It's a shame, all I could do is read the letters they left behind.\nJakob left me a note, inviting me to his and Rene's lab. There's something they want to talk to me about.\nI hope I can get out of bed soon.\n\n...\nAnn brought flowers for me, but they had already wilted by the time I woke up.\nTook the day off.\n\n...\nI was able to get out of bed today.\nThis is where I first met Alain. For a time afterwards, my first time standing here I documented the experimental procedures and phenomena based on his oral descriptions. He was trying to start up the machinery below in an ill-fitting lab coat. Rene and Jakob later entered through that door, and Alain would temporarily forget to act the young genius, and rush towards them like an energetic kid.\nI found myself witness to the first successful controlled annihilation reaction. The brilliant light cast a deep, dark shadow and I believe history was made in that moment. Can someone like me, so excited I knocked over the ink bottle, play a role in such a historical event?\nBehind the locked door on the other side is Rene and Jakob's lab. It seems access was limited due to the dangerous nature of their research. They are destined to become towering figures in history.\nI guess Alain moved to another lab. Based on his plan, once the energy problem was solved, he would study kinematics. I'll go greet him later. I wonder how Ann is doing now? I wonder what kind of beautiful woman she will grow up to be?\nI'll stop writing here. I don't have much time left.\nI hope everything goes well."},{"id":"Book668","title":"Book668","filename":"Book668_EN.txt","text":"...\n...Following Guillotin's instructions, the research went well...

According to legend, the gentle Egeria shed the first tear, from which the first Oceanid was born. Some say that Egeria felt great sympathy for dragons, and others say she felt great sadness over the eventual fate of humanity. Now, all that we have left is a metaphorical representation whose true meaning remains unclear: \"The lizard's bones dissolved into mud, from which swans emerged.\"\nThe newborn Oceanid was bestowed with the task of comprehending all forms of life: to seek an understanding of the diverse array of species and to love every creature. It emerged from the sea of life, possessing the power of metamorphosis. Egeria wished it to use this power to etch the essence of living creatures into its being and it gradually developed a yearning for life. Once it gained enough understanding of humanity, it shed its first tear upon the earth. We have used \"she\" to refer to the first and her lineage ever since.\nThis is the origin of Oceanids.\n(A small addendum: Perhaps you believe that this kind of document has no scientific value, asserting that physical evidence and records suggest that the origin of Oceanids predates Egeria and the even earlier realm of Remuria, and you reckon that only Evolutionary Diversity of Forest Pigs: Field Tracking Research on Geographically Distinct Forms counts as genuine research. So, I have a question for you: Do you dare to explore our own origins? The gods unleash thunder in anger, and goddesses cry oceans in sorrow — these things are real.)\n\n...\nOceanids display considerable disparities in cognitive capacity, partially due to differences in lifespan resulting in very different levels of experience and knowledge regarding the world, but substantial individual variation in the Oceanids themselves also contributes to this phenomenon. Some Oceanids are simply too obtuse to complete tasks related to the continent's water systems and are thus confined to Fontaine, where they assist in soothing human emotions.\n\n...\nThe increase in the number of Oceanids (we have previously considered breeding, proliferation, and reproduction, but none are suitable terms) does not require any pairing off or matchmaking. After gaining sufficient understanding and emotion, they approach the Hydro Archon or an elder for permission to claim... um, a thing, which results in their division into little Oceanids.\nThis thing is highly abstract, and in order to make its name more comprehensible to humans, we refer to it as a \"Helixsplit.\" However, what it is exactly remains unknown. Some believe it could be a drop of pure water essence, nurtured by the emotions and intelligence of the parent, eventually giving rise to life. Others speculate that it might be a single sound, a name, possibly even a forbidden utterance, capable of stirring the cycle of elemental forces and drawing on the desire that doesn't exist with the pure water bodies of Oceanids, allowing new life to be attracted into the world. Still, others propose that it serves as a permit, granting permission for the dreams and desires within Oceanids to be bestowed with a new name — much like the names of childhood dreams throughout the ages.\nHowever, this is a story between Oceanids, and humans have no hope to know it.\n\n...\nThe propagation of all Oceanids needs to be officially registered. If something were to happen to Egeria (No disrespect intended— may she keep some blessings for herself), the Oceanid elders will also ensure the continuation of their species. But in the event of a more calamitous occurrence, what will happen to the Oceanids?"},{"id":"Book674","title":"Book674","filename":"Book674_EN.txt","text":"...\n...Though it's a shame, we'll have to miss it.

It's not what you said before.\"\nOh, come on, it's just a story, there's no need to be so fussy. And so the story goes...\nAnyway, a protagonist needs an antagonist... an evil one, at that!\nAnd our evil antagonist... Well, that's the dragon Narcissus. So evil is he that the peace-loving people tremble at the sound of his name— not that he cares about their feelings, though.\nHe sowed destruction across the land with the searing flames he spewed from his mouth. His great wings turned cities to dust and his burning breath reduced nations to ash.\nAt last, only the Princess's realm remained safe. But because the Princess worked tirelessly to defend her realm, Narcissus's plot to destroy everything could not succeed.\n\"So, in Narcissus's story, I'm the evil villain?\"\nOh? That could be the case, were he the one telling the tale. Something like \"and my plans would have succeeded, if not for that blasted Princess Lyris\"... or something like that.\nAh, no. I told you that it's just a story, right? Princess Lyris is just a character, she's made up. You're you, and you're real. Don't get mixed up, okay? \n\"I don't get it...\"\nOh, be patient. Stop cutting me off! Just let me finish the story first, alright? Now, where were we?\nOh, I almost forgot. Our protagonist needs assistants. Princess Lyris, kind and beautiful as she is, must surely have a ton of friends who are willing to lend a helping hand.\nLet me see... Princess Lyris has a whole bunch of brave and loyal friends, like Al and Ney...\n\"That can't be.\"\nCome on! It's just a story. Anything is possible! In our version, Al and Ney are both friends with Lyris.\nAh, yes, what was Lyris's other friend's name again? The little guy with flaxen hair.\n\"He's not my friend.\"\nBut Princess Lyris can be friends with him, right? I wanna be friends with him too. So, let's let him come along, shall we? What's his name, again?\n\"Alright. Let's call him Kate.\"\nAh! Then Colonel Kate it is. I mean, he's always got that cool and aloof feel to him. Plus, he's always buried in books, so a rank like that really suits him.\nWell, there we have it — we've assembled all the characters for the story! The fearsome dragon, Narcissus, sought to destroy every kingdom upon the land, while Princess Lyris's realm stood strong and unassailable under the protection of her and her trusty friends!\n\"Yeah, I get it. And just as in those stories, the princess and her friends lived happily ever after, forever and ever.\"\nThat's how stories end!\n\nWe've only just begun. We haven't even reached the exciting parts yet.\n\"Exciting parts?\"\nOf course. After all, why would Narcissus want to destroy everything? And how would Lyris protect everybody? Aren't you the least bit curious about that?\n\"Knowing the ending is good enough, isn't it?\"\nWell, that wouldn't be much fun, would it? The endings may seem alike, but the twists and turns in each story set them apart.\nJust like our story, the lonely Narcissus coveted Lyris's treasure and envied her beauty and kindness, for they were what the dragon once possessed but later lost.\nAs for the treasure that Lyris possesses... let's just say that it's \"time.\"\n\"'Time'?\"\nThat's right! Al once told me, as I recall, that clocks are proof that \"people want to hold time in their hands,\" and Ney said that time always seems to be running out. And Lyris has been lonely for a very long time, hasn't she? If she has friends, if she could share her \"time\" with them, then she would be happy! So let's say Narcissus failed to invade Lyris's realm, for she had shared all this time with her friends. So when they fought him, they had more time on their side — that's why the dragon was no match for Lyris's friends!\nThink about it, Lyris — if we had more time, wouldn't we be able to do more things? For example, Al could strike Narcissus three or four more times — he'd be way stronger with more time! Yup, so that's how we're doing this!\nFollowing that, Lyris's friends made use of the time she had shared with them to thwart Narcissus again and again.\nHowever, the cunning dragon discovered their secret. Like a patient viper, he kept sending his armies to attack, depleting Lyris's time.\nThus did Princess Lyris sacrifice much to protect the kingdom and help her friends win their battles. Over time, she forgot about her friends, because she had given away her past. She no longer laughed and played with her friends, as she had given away her time in the present...\nOne day, finally, the once cheerful spring water fell silent and gloom filled the skies with Narcissus's coming, his wings spread wide. Despite the valiant efforts of Lyris's friends in battle, the dragon was unstoppable, for she had no more time to share with them. The dragon soon arrived before the palace.\nIn the final moments, Lyris gathered her friends, whose names she had no longer remembered, around her and entrusted them with the most precious thing in the world. It was a pure drop of water — yes, as pure as you are.\nShe said, \"This is my future. Take it with you.\"\nShe said: \"Even if I and the kingdom become subject to Narcissus, it shall not matter, for my 'future' shall lie with you.\"\nThen, she made them a promise. \"Even if we have lost our shared 'past' and 'present,' as long as we hold on to the future, the time will come again when we shall reunite, and the kingdom will shine again once more.\"\nAt that moment, the dragon's army blew down the castle gates open with cannon-fire. Lyris urged her friends to flee, which they did only with great difficulty and tearstained faces. Now having lost her future, Princess Lyris, along with the tower she lived in, fell into a stagnant slumber devoid of dreams.\nSo fell the last remaining kingdom of light. Lyris's friends hid in the darkness and endured hardships for a long time. Yet they remained united, bound together by the future the princess had promised them. Well, how do you find the story now?\n\"I don't understand. The past, the present, and the future... I don't get them either. We have no future after such a disaster.\"\nYou see, Al is working hard to assist Lord Neville and secure our future. And aren't you, Ney, and Jak all striving together to create one? Together — that's how we've created much of our \"past,\" right? Now, we are united in the \"present,\" we can surely be together in the \"future,\" too. We'll share the burden of many sorrows and create many joyful moments, too.\n\"Yup, I know...\"\n\"...What about the story, then? What happened to the princess?\"\nHmm... We'll have to save that for another story. Ah, I'm running short on time. Need to head back with that silly dog of mine. I'll share the rest with you next time!\nOh, come on, don't be like that... Alright, how about I come up with the beginning, and you tell me the rest next time? Ahem. Let me think...\n\n\"A long, long time in the future, in a place far, far away...\"\nThere was a dark empire ruled by the fell dragon Narcissus.\nThe princess he once yearned for had, together with the high tower in which she lived, plunged into a stagnant slumber devoid of dreams, thus remaining untouched by the evil dragon. This enraged Narcissus, so he sent out countless minions to scour the empire for her treasure. He also set up many defensive mechanisms using his baleful sorceries to prevent those on the side of justice from resisting him. He swore that he would reclaim the princess' treasure and awaken her, for only then could he claim her wholly for his own.\nThere was a group of heroes who protected the treasure that the princess had entrusted to them - a clear, bright pearl of water.\nOne day, a tiny life was born from this pearl of water.\nHmm... and what shall we call this life?

However, when it comes to Elynas itself, even the adults seem to be at a total loss. They simply cordoned off the surrounding area. Nevertheless, it was quite easy to sneak in. It felt rather strange slipping into the creature's mouth, and it reminded me of events from some of the stories I once read...\n\n...Though I have no substantive evidence, I still sensed some sort of \"will\" from it. Jakob did, too... There were no signs of decay in the flesh. Instead, its body was hardening, as if forming a protective membrane. Given its current immobilized state, it looked like a self-defense mechanism to safeguard its internal organs...\n...But it does make sense, with such a wellspring of vitality... If my deduction is correct, it may also be used to enhance Jakob's strength by following the same principle... However, at this stage, there's no need to subject Jakob to such risks. I should get safe experimental data first through the Institute of Natural Philosophy, and then set specific research objectives. Although, as Jakob mentioned, this may waste a lot of precious time...\n...After all, the flesh of Elynas remains toxic, and the risk if Jakob...\n\n...Jakob has returned. He's quite brave, but also an idiot. He didn't give any thought to the possible consequences. We have no one else to rely on now. If he...\n...The data we've collected is still incomplete.

It's only possible because Jakob completely trusts me... Our lives are limited. Still, even if it's just for the future, we must find a way to get allies, get stronger, and prevent disaster...\n\n...Alain has enrolled in the Institute of Natural Philosophy. He should fit right in with his sharp mind. I brought the pocket watch he gave us, and we compared the time only to find there was already a significant discrepancy... We agreed to meet at the Institute. The brightest minds of Fontaine are gathered there, and we can expect to make huge progress and get much-needed help...\n...As for Mary-Ann, just the sight of her fills me with joy. We had a long discussion about the Narzissenkreuz Institute, but Jakob was crying through most of it... I didn't tell them about Jakob. It's because Uncle Guillotin, who was with them, is part of the Maison Gardiennage. Although he seems to be treating Alain and Mary-Ann very well, he still can't be trusted.

As before, the flesh and blood of the great beast Elynas is being used as nutrition. Jakob seems to have gotten used to it, so there's nothing to worry about anymore.

It's a relief to know that his physical condition hasn't been harmed...\n...Jakob still eats, but only out of habit and no longer as a necessity for survival. But I suppose it's a good thing, because eating together is nice. It suddenly occurred to me that jam was somewhat similar to the flesh and blood of Elynas, so I made a joke about it. Jakob seemed quite uncomfortable...\n...The results have improved significantly in comparison to previous tests. Perhaps more can be done... Then the next step would be to attempt the opening of a \"passage\"...\n\n...The \"passage\" was opened successfully, though it only lasted a short while.

On the contrary, he spoke to us about the similarities and differences between humans and machines, and between artificial intelligence and personality. Uh-oh, this is bad, at this rate he might really turn into a villain like that...\n\n...I was disappointed to discover that quality of the people from the Institute is worse than I expected. I expected the people here to be smarter and more open to new ideas than those in high positions outside, but the reality has been infuriating.

I even explained the risks, its historical baggage, and my other objective: To create a second sample that can corroborate the realization of human transcendence via ██, and derive the holistic character and method from it. Carter isn't very good at thinking scientifically, so I used many examples and methods of emphasis.

I got more materials in an attempt to reverse it. All sorts of relics and biological tissue from after the calamity. I even got my hands on extremely dangerous residue. Nothing worked. But I can't give up. He's still \"alive\" right now. At the very least, in this sense, it can continue. It cannot be a waste.\n\n...\n...He's preserved for now and further tissue collapse has been prevented.

I've tried cutting out the organs where his vocal cords probably are, but they grow back in one to three days...\n\n...\n...Alain and I have completely broken off our working relationship. It's regrettable, but I don't blame him... The most regrettable part is the previous direction was proved to be ineffective, but it wasn't all for naught.

Most were built by locals who prayed to them for favorable weather and peace steadfast as the mountains. But it is claimed that some have a much more ancient history.\nOne story regarding the animal statues in particular is popular among the fishermen of the Bishui River, the Silvergrass harvesters of Dihua Marsh, and the old mining crowd. They say that in some corners of the land, ancient stone beasts wake at night in the cool of the fall and look around at a world that has slowly become alien to them. Hearing the sounds of frogs and insects greeting them, they respond with deep, soulful cries from their petrified throats. Then they roam around Liyue, inspecting once more the land they used to protect.\nTo my knowledge, no one has ever witnessed a stone beast in motion firsthand. However, local residents who know the territory extremely well have long observed and accepted the phenomenon that the animal statues can change location and posture overnight. Meanwhile, light-sleeping campers often report hearing a sound in the middle of the night that is like flowing water, only much deeper in tone.\nAs for where these stone beasts originally came from, the elders of Qingce Village say they are illuminated beasts who once fought alongside Rex Lapis in the Archon War. After the war ended, the tide subsided and peace was restored. The illuminated beasts were no longer required to serve as defenders of the common people, and one by one they retreated to more secluded parts of the country. There they lived free from concern for mortal affairs.\nBut some illuminated beasts remembered with fondness the glorious days when they served under Rex Lapis, and they pined for the years they protected Liyue. Though they were not of the mortal realm, nor were they immortal: For them, too, life would one day come to an end. Thus, they beseeched Rex Lapis to turn their ephemeral flesh bodies into everlasting stone. The merciful Geo Archon granted their request and made them as such."},{"id":"Book730","title":"Book730","filename":"Book730_EN.txt","text":"After getting the boot from the Order of the Fruit, I was really down in the dumps.

They were clad in strange armor and carried small, short swords. Ferocious and oppressive, they soon took over the homes of the local fish.\n\"Haha! This belongs to the Spikey Fish Kings now!\"\nTo reclaim their homeland and eject the invaders, the fish of Mondstadt asked the strong and imaginative Dodoco and the cheerful and kind Spark Knight for help...\n\"Jumpy... Eh? We can't use Jumpy Dumpty this time?\"\nThe powerful Jumpy Dumpty bomb would destroy the houses the fish were trying to reclaim, and the lakebed would be utterly wrecked. Another idea was needed.\n\nThe clever Dodoco and the Spark Knight discussed the problem at length, and came up with the \"Super-Special, Super-Safe, Super-Reliable Jumpy Dumpty\" — small and precise enough to blow up only the bad Spikey Fish, leaving the innocent fishies unharmed.\nBut the name — \"Super-Special, Super-Safe, Super-Reliable Jumpy Dumpty\" — was a little long, and the Spark Knight kept saying it wrong. So, they called the new device the \"Special Jumpy Dumpty\" instead!\n\"Wait! Allow me to listen out...\"\nIt turned out that Dodoco's long ears weren't just for show. They were great for picking up sounds!\nOnce thrown into the lake, Special Jumpy Dumpties would swim toward wherever the Spikey Fish were active, and Dodoco could hear it all!\nThat allowed the Special Jumpy Dumpties to work their magic at exactly the right spot, defeating the Spikey Fish!\n\nBut the enemy seemed prepared. There were so many of them! The Spark Knight and Dodoco rushed back and forth, not even stopping to eat. They were almost out of Special Jumpy Dumpties!\n\"You think you two are enough to beat us, conquerors of the five seas!?\"\nBut what were the \"five seas\" the Spikey Fish spoke of? Could they have overpowered the fish in other places as well?\nFlummoxed, Dodoco and the Spark Knight returned to the Athenaeum to inquire with the \"Scribe Witch.\"\nWithout needing to crack open a book, the witch chuckled softly:\n\"Perhaps these 'five seas' simply refer to the north, east, south, west, and center of Cider Lake.\"\nIt finally dawned on the Spark Knight and Dodoco — they'd fallen for a fish story!\nUnfortunately, the slippery Spike Fishes had seized this opportunity to construct a sturdy barrier reef. They then expertly hid among the aquatic plants, kicking off a devious game of hide-and-seek with Dodoco and the Spark Knight...\nNow these thorny fishies would be an even greater thorn in their sides!\n\nDodoco and the Spark Knight thus called in help — the Honorary Knight and the Helper in White. With ample experience between them, the two offered just the advice they needed.\nLooking at a map, the Honorary Knight said:\n\"Just like with any adventure, you must first determine the direction in which to advance.\"\nDodoco understood — by finding a way to control the direction of the blast, they could enhance the Special Jumpy Dumpties' power and reach Spikey Fish further away!\nBetween mouthfuls of dessert, the Helper in White said:\n\"And if you can make the explosions take all sorts of forms, they'll be even harder to evade!\"\nThe Spark Knight then had an idea: If they made the Special Jumpy Dumpty explode into the shapes of different desserts, they could lure the gluttonous Spikey Fish and wipe them out in one blast!\n\nSo, Dodoco and the Spark Knight upgraded the Special Jumpy Dumpty with a new ability.\nThis new-and-improved Special Jumpy Dumpty could explode in various shapes that could pass through the lake plants and reach the enemy soldiers hiding in even the trickiest locations.\nEven if they couldn't deal with the unyielding stones, they could circumvent them — delivering an explosive surprise to the nasty fish behind it.\nArmed with these Special Jumpy Dumpties, Dodoco and the Spark Knight no longer had to worry about being ambushed by the Spikey Fish!\n\nOne after another, the Spikey Fish were defeated. When word of this finally reached the Spikey Fish Kings, they swelled up angrily and stormed in to join the battle!\nIn the Honorary Knight and the Helper in White's experience, bulbous blobs were always bad news!\nWhen they looked over to the opposing side and saw the hulking Kings, glimmering in gold, they wondered — how were there suddenly so many of them?\nNo matter how they sliced it, this was all rather fishy...\nBetween mouthfuls of dessert, the Helper in White said:\n\"There's nothing to be afraid of!

They were clad in strange armor and carried small, short swords. Ferocious and oppressive, they soon took over the homes of the local fish.\n\"Haha! This belongs to the Spikey Fish Kings now!\"\nTo reclaim their homeland and eject the invaders, the fish of Mondstadt asked the strong and imaginative Dodoco and the cheerful and kind Spark Knight for help...\n\"Jumpy... Eh? We can't use Jumpy Dumpty this time?\"\nThe powerful Jumpy Dumpty bomb would destroy the houses the fish were trying to reclaim, and the lakebed would be utterly wrecked. Another idea was needed.\n\nThe clever Dodoco and the Spark Knight discussed the problem at length, and came up with the \"Super-Special, Super-Safe, Super-Reliable Jumpy Dumpty\" — small and precise enough to blow up only the bad Spikey Fish, leaving the innocent fishies unharmed.\nBut the name — \"Super-Special, Super-Safe, Super-Reliable Jumpy Dumpty\" — was a little long, and the Spark Knight kept saying it wrong. So, they called the new device the \"Special Jumpy Dumpty\" instead!\n\"Wait! Allow me to listen out...\"\nIt turned out that Dodoco's long ears weren't just for show. They were great for picking up sounds!\nOnce thrown into the lake, Special Jumpy Dumpties would swim toward wherever the Spikey Fish were active, and Dodoco could hear it all!\nThat allowed the Special Jumpy Dumpties to work their magic at exactly the right spot, defeating the Spikey Fish!\n\nBut the enemy seemed prepared. There were so many of them! The Spark Knight and Dodoco rushed back and forth, not even stopping to eat. They were almost out of Special Jumpy Dumpties!\n\"You think you two are enough to beat us, conquerors of the five seas!?\"\nBut what were the \"five seas\" the Spikey Fish spoke of? Could they have overpowered the fish in other places as well?\nFlummoxed, Dodoco and the Spark Knight returned to the Athenaeum to inquire with the \"Scribe Witch.\"\nWithout needing to crack open a book, the witch chuckled softly:\n\"Perhaps these 'five seas' simply refer to the north, east, south, west, and center of Cider Lake.\"\nIt finally dawned on the Spark Knight and Dodoco — they'd fallen for a fish story!\nUnfortunately, the slippery Spike Fishes had seized this opportunity to construct a sturdy barrier reef. They then expertly hid among the aquatic plants, kicking off a devious game of hide-and-seek with Dodoco and the Spark Knight...\nNow these thorny fishies would be an even greater thorn in their sides!\n\nDodoco and the Spark Knight thus called in help — the Honorary Knight and the Helper in White. With ample experience between them, the two offered just the advice they needed.\nLooking at a map, the Honorary Knight said:\n\"Just like with any adventure, you must first determine the direction in which to advance.\"\nDodoco understood — by finding a way to control the direction of the blast, they could enhance the Special Jumpy Dumpties' power and reach Spikey Fish further away!\nBetween mouthfuls of dessert, the Helper in White said:\n\"And if you can make the explosions take all sorts of forms, they'll be even harder to evade!\"\nThe Spark Knight then had an idea: If they made the Special Jumpy Dumpty explode into the shapes of different desserts, they could lure the gluttonous Spikey Fish and wipe them out in one blast!\n\nSo, Dodoco and the Spark Knight upgraded the Special Jumpy Dumpty with a new ability.\nThis new-and-improved Special Jumpy Dumpty could explode in various shapes that could pass through the lake plants and reach the enemy soldiers hiding in even the trickiest locations.\nEven if they couldn't deal with the unyielding stones, they could circumvent them — delivering an explosive surprise to the nasty fish behind it.\nArmed with these Special Jumpy Dumpties, Dodoco and the Spark Knight no longer had to worry about being ambushed by the Spikey Fish!\n\nOne after another, the Spikey Fish were defeated. When word of this finally reached the Spikey Fish Kings, they swelled up angrily and stormed in to join the battle!\nIn the Honorary Knight and the Helper in White's experience, bulbous blobs were always bad news!\nWhen they looked over to the opposing side and saw the hulking Kings, glimmering in gold, they wondered — how were there suddenly so many of them?\nNo matter how they sliced it, this was all rather fishy...\nBetween mouthfuls of dessert, the Helper in White said:\n\"There's nothing to be afraid of! Maybe these Kings just used berries to paint themselves gold!\"\nLooking at a map, the Honorary Knight said:\n\"Even if they dyed themselves with Nilotpala Lotuses, their strength would only increase by 50%.

It was time to collect the bride.\nThe Sea God looked majestic indeed as he sat center stage in his giant clam, holding in his hands the reins of two sea serpents. They stood as imposing as Mt. Tianheng before the royal carriage as their master accepted the gift of pearls from the village elders and welcomed his new bride aboard the carriage. In return, the village would receive the Sea God's blessing: a year free from tempests and tsunamis.\n\nThe bride was whisked away to a place deep beneath the waves, far from home, far from the reveling crowds celebrating the festival, and far from her mother all alone. The Sea God took her along a corridor of great columns, formed from the skeleton of a dead whale, that led to a palatial gate adorned with shining pearls and iridescent shells. Finally, the young bride had arrived at the palace the Sea God had made for her. The palace that was to be her new home.\n\"It was not my plan to meddle in the affairs of common people,\" came the god's voice rippling through the water. It was a husband's attempt to console his bride.\n\"This place has served as a new home for many other young women, and it also became the place they spent their final days. Many of them were driven away from the village where they were born. For them, the ocean has provided safe refuge. Somewhere they could sleep peacefully without fear of being disturbed. Somewhere they could call home.\"\n\nBut this young woman did not want a new home decorated with prize pearls and rare shells. The dazzling spectacle of the ocean floor — and the creatures that she knew lurked in the darkness — filled her not with peace, but with dread. Time went by, and the longer she stayed in her bewildering ocean chamber that knew not sunrise nor sunset, the more homesick she grew — and the frailer she became.\nEventually, there came a day when the Sea God sensed what his young bride was feeling. Though he was saddened by her choice, he allowed her to go through with her decision.\n\"In the fallen world of the humans, there will come a day in your life when you regret this decision.\" The Sea God took the shell of a sea snail that adorned his waist and handed it to her as a parting gift.\n\"There will come a day that you blow into this shell, and it will sound like a horn. On that day, you shall return to this place.\"\n\nThe young woman took the shell and returned to the land. The years went by, and soon she became a mother herself. As she went about her simple, peaceful life, the ocean palace seemed but a childhood dream. The dazzling sights and grotesque creatures would once in a while flood into her mind from the murky depths of her memory, but it was a rare occurrence, and she put them out of her mind. She lived like this year after year. Until one year, when the festival came once again, the village elders came to her home. They had come to take her daughter from her arms. It was then that she finally understood why the Sea God had spoken of her regret, and of her return, all those years ago.\nOn the eve of the festival, she blew into the shell, and it sounded like a horn.\nThe Sea God responded to the call, rising up from the billowing waves to greet the village. But his embrace was a tidal wave that engulfed the village, and took the villagers and elders in their sleep. Drawn by giant sea serpents, a colossal clam carriage came to a halt in front of her, dazzling her with its shimmering pearls.\nThe mother took her daughter by the hand and boarded the Sea God's clam. It was just like she remembered from her childhood — only this time, the village she left behind now lay in ruins beneath the ocean waves."},{"id":"Book740","title":"Book740","filename":"Book740_EN.txt","text":"<image name=UI_ReadPic_Photo_Boy/>\nAdventurer {NICKNAME} \nIn assisting the Fontaine Research Institute in various assignments, they assumed their duties brilliantly and took the relevant obligations seriously.\nDuring the process of performing their tasks, {NICKNAME} stuck to the principle of patience first, followed by diligence.

The algorithm has been improved by our project team and has been temporarily designated as the \"Comprehensive Combat Formula\" (CCF).\nWithin the CCF's data systems, this meka must ultimately reach the following combat and engineering targets:\n1. As the vanguard, create an opening in the frontlines, withstand enemy attacks seven times those of standard units, and still advance a distance of ten combat platoons.\n2. While in cruising mode, detect and defeat all monsters on both sides of the route within a distance three times the range of a pistolet.\n3. Engage and hold off an enemy on the same level as the Emperor of Fire and Iron until reinforcements arrive.\n4. When encountering an obstacle smaller than a standard three-story Fontainian building, overcome it within half an hour and continue forward.\n5. When attacking an enemy stronghold, remain unaffected by concentrated attacks from light weapons, destroy the enemy's defensive structures within two hours, and drive the enemy out of their defensive positions.\nIn order to achieve these targets, the meka will be built in three batches of three, for a total of nine prototypes. The three batch types are listed below:\nFull System Prototype: Verify the power, movement, and combat systems.\nInitial Operational Viability: Solve the problems exposed by the prototype batch. Begin beta tester group participation to optimize the meka's structure based on man-machine interaction and aesthetics.\nFull Operational Viability: One of the prototypes will be deployed with the testing group while two are retained by the project team.\nMass production of this meka can be achieved using the developmental experience and test data from the nine prototypes.\n..."},{"id":"Book75","title":"Book75","filename":"Book75_EN.txt","text":"—The Hermit—\nThe stone forest of Jueyun Karst is a mysterious place engulfed in mist all year round. Myths and legends abound among the herb gatherers, telling of adepti and evil spirits.\nOnce, there was a herb seller named Qiangu who went to Jueyun Karst to investigate the distribution of medicinal herbs there. Unbeknownst to him, a group of brigands had followed him into the mountains. They waited for cover of night, and when he let his guard down they struck. He was knocked unconscious. The brigands grabbed his possessions, bound him from head to foot, and left him alone in the valley.\nDeep in the night, the herb seller finally awoke. He struggled against the ropes that bound him, and cried out for help. But the vast mountains did not respond. The only sounds to be heard in the thick mountain forest, save for the echoes of his own pitiful wails, were the faint cries of the birds disturbed by them.\nQiangu sank into despair and sighed with sorrow. Just when he thought all hope was lost, a deep voice came rumbling through the mountains, cutting through the cries of nocturnal birds and the whistling of the wind.\n\"Arise!\"\n\"I am unable to!\" The herb seller protested amidst floods of tears. His cry frightened off a fox that was prowling in the night. But as he tensed his body once more against the ropes that bound him, he discovered they had completely loosened.\nThe herb seller stood up. No sooner had he arisen than the disembodied voice, without pausing to hear the expression of gratitude that would be customary in such situations, spoke to him once more:\n\"Ascend!\"\nAs instructed, Qiangu ascended the mountain, following the winding dirt track to the summit as the horizon began to glow in the east. From the summit he saw a twisted and withered pine growing on a cliff, its branches sprawling outwards as if trying to escape into the air. The gentle creaking of the branches drew his attention to the ropes that hung from them — at the other end of which hung the brigands from the night before, bound in like fashion from head to foot.\nThen he saw the old man whose voice he had heard, his hair and beard as white as snow, sat atop a curiously shaped rock as if it were his throne. The old man took one look at Qiangu's disheveled appearance and grinned mischievously before returning his possessions to him intact.\nQiangu inquired as to the old man's origins, but he replied that he belonged to the mountains, his home being wherever he roamed and his bed being wherever he laid his head. Qiangu sought to thank the old man with all manner of courtesies and compensations, but he dismissed them all. After much deliberation, he took just a single Mora to one day give as a wedding gift to Qiangu's beloved daughter, in order that he might attend the wedding feast.\nOut of disaster seemed to spring forth good fortune, for following this incident Qiangu's store grew ever more popular, while word of the wealthy herb seller himself spread far and wide. Some say that after making his fortune, he returned to Jueyun Karst in search of the old man, but found nothing save for a few abandoned tents and empty wine bottles. Some claim to have spotted the old man at Yaoguang Shoal, disguised as a miner and darting around like the wind between the precipices. Others insist he is a fisherman who spends his time saving those who become stranded at sea. The stories are too many to count, and yet no one knows the old man's name.\nLamentably, age and ill health have now ushered in the twilight years of Qiangu's life while his beloved daughter remains unmarried. Perhaps the day will still come that the old man from the mountain attends the wedding feast, but that day seems impossibly far in the future for Qiangu."},{"id":"Book760","title":"Book760","filename":"Book760_EN.txt","text":"...\nPart XVII: Movement Mechanism Design Iterations\nIn short, based on the Full System Prototype tests, simply increasing the dimensions of existing humanoid clockwork meka is not technologically feasible.\nThis meka is required to, ideally, be able to operate across various types of terrain, including hard city roads, dense woodlands, beaches, and even muddy swamps.\nIf the bipedal locomotion of humanoid meka is adopted, the meka would be considered a total loss upon entering environments with loose and soft soil. It would be impossible to recover it with Fontaine's current transportation capabilities.\nThis problem is due to the weight of the power system and the combat system far exceeding our expectations.\nCurrently, a power system capable of driving this meka is still under development, so we have been forced to use multiple, connected mass-produced clockwork meka cores, and the power-to-weight ratio is quite low.\nBut even if it is replaced with an optimized power system, the meka's total weight will not decrease significantly.\nThe combat system's weight is crucial. In order to ensure combat capabilities meet the prescribed goals, the armor, weapons, and ammunition cannot be reduced in either size or weight. Otherwise, we would only be weakening the meka further.\nThus, a multi-wheel structure or the Crawler Track Movement Mechanism being designed by another research group is a far more realistic design proposition than humanoid legs.\nIf a track with considerable width is utilized, the meka will be able to traverse various adverse terrain while maintaining the highest combat efficiency.\nFurthermore, the tests run on the Full System Prototype validated a basic conjecture:\n\"Weight is the parameter of all man-made meka and equipment. When the right parts are utilized, weight is equal to combat power. As such, weight should be made a priority when designing any meka.\"\nThe results derived from this theory will be presented by our project team at the conference.\n..."},{"id":"Book761","title":"Book761","filename":"Book761_EN.txt","text":"...\nPart XXXIV: Crew Optimization and Combat System Iterations\n...\nBased on the data from the first IOV prototype with modified movement systems, the testers have made several suggestions to further optimize the meka.\n1. Change the number of crew from three to four in order to improve the meka's operability.\nCurrently, the three members of the crew respectively act as Navigation Controller, Combat Controller, and Commander. This is sufficient to manage the movement, control, and combat.\nHowever, the testers pointed out that a single combat controller is incapable of managing the weapons on both the meka's arms, so at least one assistant is required.\nMoreover, the additional manpower may also reduce the burden of maintenance on the crew.\n2. Replace the fixed weapons with modular interfaces. Weapons or large mechanical arms for grabbing things can be installed selectively before departure.\nThe meka often encounters obstacles. The constant need for collisions against the chassis and movement systems to clear obstacles significantly reduces the meka's lifespan and greatly increases its rate of failure on the battlefield.\nTherefore, installing large mechanical arms is beneficial to clearing obstacles. Just a simple two-claw structure will be sufficient to pick up trees that are difficult to push away via collision, benefiting the entire meka team.\nAdditionally, while on missions against hilichurls and groups of common wildlife, costly ranged weapons or melee weapons with high energy consumption like the large impact drill will no longer be necessary.\nWith large mechanical arms installed, the meka can rely on its size and strength advantage to crush its targets and reduce operating costs.\n3. Install an internal cabin to accommodate combat personnel and Gardemeks to provide protection and improve the endurance of said Gardemeks.\nAt present, there is ample storage space within the meka, and it is currently being used to store spare parts and supplies for the crew, and it features a crew lounge and tea kettle.\nHowever, based on our tests, even if the four-member crew system is adopted, servicing the meka on the frontlines by the crew alone is impossible. Support from a specialized engineer is required.\nAdditionally, the allocated supplies are sufficient to last the crew for a year. Obviously, it's impossible that the meka's crew would consume the full quantity of supplies on a single mission.\nThus, modifying the internal space used to store spare parts and supplies into a crew cabin for carrying combat personnel and Gardemeks into battle is entirely feasible.\nAt the same time, the testers also suggested keeping the lounge, and especially the tea kettle, citing that both will be vital to morale...\n..."},{"id":"Book762","title":"Book762","filename":"Book762_EN.txt","text":"Introduction\nSince Monsieur Bossuet became the supervisor of the Bossuet Research Institute (formerly known as Alain Guillotin Memorial Research Institute), his flawless decisions and wise leadership have led to remarkable results in multiple research areas.\nOut of respect and in gratitude to Monsieur Bossuet (Note: I am absolutely not being mandated to do this by Monsieur Bossuet himself), his highly original research results shall be collected here for future reference.\n\nJunior Researcher Chisseray\n\n...\n\nTitle: Theoretical Analysis and Design of the Novel Artificed Core Configuration\nAuthors: Bossuet and Chisseray\nIntroduction: This paper introduces a new theoretical artificed core configuration, elaborates on the operating principle and design requirements of the configuration, and compares it to the traditional configuration (Guillotin Configuration).

The rich tend to use woven balls with silk from the Silk Flower, while the poor fashion theirs from colored paper or cloth. But the custom itself is observed in the same fashion at all of Liyue's weddings, even though the fortunes of individual families may differ.\nSome say the Liyue custom was originally adopted from the Ludi Harpastum festival celebrated in the neighboring Wind Kingdom of Mondstadt. Others say it dates back to before the Archon War when the Salt God roamed free in Liyue. She once stood shoulder to shoulder with the many gods of Liyue, but her extraordinarily gentle nature saw her quickly ousted in the hubris of the Archon War, before being ruthlessly murdered by one of her own followers.\nHer remains are likely to be found somewhere in the ruins of the area known as \"Sal Terrae.\" According to a legend that time has unfortunately stripped of all useful detail, she once handed out bunches of flowers to her people as a blessing to them. Or at least, if not a blessing, then a small gesture of comfort to stave off the bitterness of wartime existence. In any case, following her return to the elements, it is conceivable that her followers spread across Liyue, took this custom with them, and taught it to the locals. The people of Liyue being a competitive and fun-loving folk, they may then have adapted it and embellished upon it to suit their own preferences.\nDespite being a benign and joyful celebration at heart, security logs from the Millelith indicate that the throwing of flower balls is responsible for a significant number of injuries every year. In fact, the number of cases is more or less the same as those caused by monster attacks."},{"id":"Book770","title":"Book770","filename":"Book770_EN.txt","text":"(From this page onward the diary stops, to be replaced with lyrics from musicals.

He lowered the tides, raised Mt. Tianheng, and calmed the waves. Thereupon, peace was brought to the people. They cut into the mountain and found jade, they bored through the rock and made tunnels, and they piled up stones and built a settlement. It is written that the jade from the bowels of the mountain is that which glows. Hence, they named it \"Shanhui Fort\"[1]. In that time, all the people of Tianheng derived their livelihood from the mines, all prospered from them, and none knew poverty within a thousand-mile radius.\n\n[1] Better known today as \"Shanhui Rock,\" which is often simplified to \"Mountain Rock,\" thereby stripping the name of most of its original meaning.\n\n...\n\nGuizhong, the Lord of Dust, was an ally to the Lord of Rock. Around Mt. Tianheng, Guizhong set up a Crossbow to keep guard, and it was named the \"Guizhong Ballista.\" She brought her people to the north of Mt. Tianheng and taught them to tend the soil. Agriculture became their livelihood, and all prospered from it. The farming towns stretched for miles, and it was said that one could walk all the way to Stone Gate without ever leaving the network of pathways between the fields. Guizhong said to the Lord of Rock: \"My people had left their home and came to this place. Here, they are happy in their abodes and content in their work, thus it is as if they have returned home. Hence, what better name to call this place than 'the Plains of Returning and Departing'?\" The Lord of Rock praised the Lord of Dust for her work, and thereafter the area was named in the tongue of Liyue \"Guili Plains.\"\n\n[2] It later came to pass that the gods each strove for dominance, which brought catastrophe upon the land. Though the adepti fought to protect the Guili Plains, they could not stop the tide of war, which ravaged the plains and took the life of its ruler, Guizhong. Thereupon, the Lord of Rock Rex Lapis took his people south of Mt. Tianheng. Thus the people departed from the Guili Plains for good, never to return, and it was left to become a wilderness.\n\n...\n\nRex Lapis pacified the gods, adepti and yakshas were content in their positions, and Liyue re-entered an era of peace. Before this time, the gods waged war for centuries on end, and not one field was left unravaged. The people of Liyue turned to commerce and artisanship for their livelihood, and prospered once more. Those who prospered above the rest joined together, calling themselves the Qixing. Thus was formed the framework around which Liyue Harbor developed. Under the jurisdiction of the Qixing were all the known trades. No business of Liyue took place inside or outside the nation that was not known unto them. The Millelith also took orders from the Qixing, supporting the masses at home and suppressing the monsters at the border. Thus became the nature of Liyue's governance under Rex Lapis."},{"id":"Book780","title":"Book780","filename":"Book780_EN.txt","text":"\"In accordance with Fontainian law and the Provisional National ████████ Provisions, as well as the Mermonia Act (No. 1█2), the Narzissenkreuz Ordo is declared an illegal extremist group and a criminal organization.

Just as the people of Sumeru had specialized terminology to illustrate different stages of plant growth, Fontainians had more than twenty words describing water's various aspects. However, the ancients' study and differentiation of the spirit reached heights that we ourselves found challenging to attain... While, for the most part, it was divided into memory, wishes, soul, and persona, a spirit's qualities still carried complex distinctions... Among these, the state that came closest to the perfect freedom that divinities possessed was named \"True Will\"...

It seems that they conceive of the tribe as akin to a large, extended family.\n\nBy far the most powerful figure in the hilichurl tribe is the Shaman. Extensive field research confirms that the Shaman is the oldest member of the tribe and plays a role in it analogous to that of the parent in the family: managing major affairs and making policy decisions, based on their wealth of experience. Additionally, Shamans act as protector to their tribe using their elemental abilities. Shamans can be identified by their distinctive appearance from other tribe members: They wear horned, smiling-face masks with eye holes at the mouth, and wield a rudimentary Shaman's staff in their hands. A further identifying feature is that they will be heard chanting to themselves some form of unintelligible hymn or incantation.\n\nAge is not always the deciding factor when it comes to status in the tribe. In some tribes, Shamans are ousted from leadership by physically larger hilichurls with superior combat skills. Under leadership of this kind, such tribes tend to become more aggressive. The chiefs of these tribes can easily be identified from their large stature and ostentatious masks, which also bear horns.\n\nThe hilichurls' hostility towards outsiders, coupled with the obvious language barriers, means that conducting specific research on the distribution of resources within tribes has been all but impossible. Nevertheless, Knights of Favonius' patrol reports suggest that resources are typically shared on the basis of \"to each according to his needs.\" All tribe members are both gatherers and soldiers, but some that prize combat above others develop into seasoned heavyweights of the battlefield. If the tribe stays long enough in an unfavorable environment, these heavyweights will become its most respected leaders.\n\nInterestingly, hilichurls seem to have a unique ability to manipulate the elements despite their low intelligence and primitive social structure. This ability is most notably manifested in the Shamans. Typically, humans require a Vision in order to exercise elemental control. The question of how hilichurls are able to do so without a Vision is, therefore, one that requires further investigation and analysis."},{"id":"Book7","title":"Book7","filename":"Book7_EN.txt","text":"\"Dandelion, dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land.\"\nThe little fox chanted.\nHe blew the dandelion flower and sent the seeds flying.

It is said that in those days, birds had not yet split into domestic and wild kindreds. In those days, a crimson moon shone down upon the subterranean realm, and not the dark sun of latter days.\nDue to the Kingdom's unique position, things from outside this world were always leaking into it. The Kingdom's weapons would wipe out the calamities slipping in, but what of all the other objects? Such as, say, a child who may have come from some destroyed world?\nOne of the sages spoke thusly to the great ruler: \"Oh high lord of the nobles, a child once told me a tale of another world: Once upon a time, there were sea people who believed that the gods came from the sea. Each time they discovered a shipwrecked person, they would treat them with the utmost honor, for they believed that the gods would take the form of the shipwrecked to investigate the mortal realm.\"\nThe ruler replied, \"I do not perceive your meaning, so do as you please.\"\n(Naturally, no oceans in the traditional sense lay within the Kingdom's borders. The earliest founders of the Kingdom had once seen the majestic silhouettes of the mountains blur under the sun's searing glare, and the rippling reflections of the moonlight falling upon the sea's surface like a scattering of pearls. But at the time the story took place, only outsiders and those few who had left the Kingdom on official duties and returned could describe such sights to the ruler. The ocean and the sea were often used as a metaphor for the space projected by the stars.)\nIn anticipation of the arrival at their Kingdom of gods from beyond the so-called ocean — or rather, the arrival of beings who could transcend the gods — they founded an organization, an orphanage to take care of such children. In latter days, the orphans of the Kingdom and those who wandered in from outside were accepted as well.\n\nThe young Perinheri's first memory was that of being asked by the grown-ups to crawl through a dark corridor. This passage might have been a chimney for winter fires, for it was filled with coal ash, and there was not a single crack in it through which smoke or light could pass through. As he crawled, he would sometimes stumble in the pitch-black darkness. Fortunately, the corridor appeared designed for the passage of children in the first place, so the falls were not very painful. It also lacked any annoying cobwebs.\nWhen Perinheri reached the end at last, the exit had not opened yet. He knocked, only for the grown-ups to coldly ask: \"Are you dead?\"\nWell, how was he to reply if he was dead? But the grown-ups did not like this response. They kept asking the same question, until he at least shouted, \"Yes, I'm dead!\"\nThe adults then asked, \"Did you see it, then?\"\nPerhaps it was the fear brought on by the darkness combined with hunger and exhaustion, but Perinheri did indeed see an illusion. The crimson moon, hanging high in the pitch-dark night sky, suddenly turned around, revealing itself to be a titanic, horrified eye.\nThe adults opened the door and embraced the soot-covered Perinheri: \"You have traversed the fire of two worlds within the hearth, and here you are reborn.\"\n\nThough the crimson moon set, and the dark sun descended into a yet darker dusk, that transcendental person from beyond who the Kingdom orphanage was awaiting never arrived. But unusual individuals they had aplenty, and many of those who strode forth from the gates of that orphanage became great knights of the Kingdom. Perinheri was, in his time, the leading figure amongst their ranks — that is, unless, he were forced to compete with his best friend, Hleobrant.\nThey should have competed for glory, and decided who was superior through the amount of honors they crowned themselves in — and in the number of goblets of fine wine downed during the festivities afterward. But for some reason, their rivalry would take a mortal turn."},{"id":"Book801","title":"Book801","filename":"Book801_EN.txt","text":"That day, the orphanage welcomed a new member. She was a beautiful young lady from a foreign land who claimed to be a noble princess. Her nation had been defeated by Deus Auri, and yet the daughter of a priestly line she remained, and would not submit to the new god, and so she had drifted, wandering through the gates of their Kingdom. She called herself Angelica (Note 1), meaning \"one who is as a divine emissary.\"\nFair Angelica declared that she would only marry the mightiest knight in all the Kingdom. Perinheri cared not a whit, but Hleobrant was smitten with her. Angelica would often take walks near the Sea of Wells, and there she spoke much of the outside world to Hleobrant. Perinheri would come along out of concern for his friend, and because suspicion was born in him sooner than curiosity, he would doubt her every word, yet wished that he might see these things one day.\n\nAngelica's arrival changed Hleobrant altogether. He would cause trouble, looking for any provocation upon which to stake a duel against other knights. He would win all these bouts, and turn to Angelica to show off his prowess. Yet all she ever gave him was a cool smile, for what great feat was it for a great runner if they raced a tortoise and triumphed?\n\"Njord, who walks with the Darksprites (Note 2), Alf, the greatest warrior in the Universitas Magistrorum, Alberich, commander of half the knights, and Perinheri the undefeated.\" Angelica spoke thus of the mightiest figures in the Kingdom as she saw them.\nHaving fallen head over heels into the throes of love, Hleobrant came to what was an all-too-reasonable conclusion for himself. People might call him a traitor, or believe him mad. But even so, he had no wish to hurt Perinheri.\nAs for Perinheri, he believed that his best friend's madness would be cured, if only he could kill Angelica.\n\nIn the midst of that most merciless of pursuits, the three left the Kingdom's borders. At that very moment, Hleobrant clutched his face, and the words escaping his mouth gradually grew more like the howling of a wild beast.\nThe witch, Angelica, explained thus: \"Hleobrant is the descendant of those who forsook their god and came to the Kingdom. This is why the Kingdom's obstinately pure-blooded aristocracy persists. This is the price of betraying your own god.\"\n\"As for you, Perinheri, you are one who drifted there. Thus, you bear no such curse. You may not have the nobility to shoulder a world, but you too have your own destiny.\"\n\"And as for me? I betrayed no one, not for a moment, until my god died, so I too bear this curse not. But you now see who I truly am, yes?\"\nThe sun rose over the horizon at that moment, and Perinheri's blade slipped from his fingers, exhausted from the night-long battle. Covering his forehead with the back of his hand, he looked upon the sun for the first time. And when he glanced back at Angelica, he saw that she was neither a beautiful woman from Liyue nor a wicked witch.\n\"I am freedom, that which has broken free of fate. This is what Hleobrant sought in agony, but that which is now yours for the taking.\"\nThere was nothing before Perinheri, only vast, empty land.\n\n\nNote 1: Note that the ancient people of Liyue did not use such names. Now that I consider it, her name may have been \"Lady Miaoyin\" (Lady of Wondrous Sound) or \"Tianwang Nu\" (Servant of Tianwang).\nNote 2: The black wolves of the first edition.

Anyone who cares to look can tell it's a pack of lies, and still, they insist on extravagantly embellishing everything while bending over backward to maintain a facade of sincerity, swearing that \"I saw it all with my own eyes! Not a word of it is false!\" as though they cared not an iota how they would be ridiculed in the ages to come. For example, Xanthus Talassii filius wrote of his meetings with the barbarians in the north, speaking of how they used glass and platinum to build their prosperous polis amongst the mountains, calling their king a \"knight.\" He even claimed that they have seventy-two legions, each comprised of 66,600 soldiers, all armed with weapons forged of the purest of sourcewater, brighter even than the crystals of Machimos. In reality, he has not in his life even set foot outside of Capitolium. Forget barbarians, he's probably never even seen barbecued eel! However, it must be said his stories are interesting at least. As such, to satiate my own vanity, I felt I too must write something for posterity. However, I have no experiences worth mentioning and am unlike those respectable folks who name the cock and bull stories they concoct \"true accounts.\" So I will freely and honestly admit that everything I write is completely, utterly fabricated. After all, since I've admitted it up front like this, nobody can call me a fraud. Anyway, the events I shall now commit to paper have never been heard of before, nor experienced by anybody, and are nothing more than pure nonsense that I have fabricated with no basis in reality. It is not more truthful than tales of \"Lochknights,\" so you need not believe any of it.\n\nThus, we weighed anchor and set sail, traveling ever northward, passing through the territory of the barbarians, with a tailwind spurring us on. Our goal was simple: To see just what the edge of the ocean looks like. According to Quinctilius, the High Sea ends in impassable waterfalls in every direction, but this was, evidently, utterly wrong: after all, did not the respected Iuvenalis also write of the \"faraway kingdom in the north\"? Anyway, the farther north we went, the less land we saw. At first, there were still clusters of islands and archipelagos covering the sea's expanse, but later there were little more than tiny bare isles dotting the waves remaining. A few days of sailing later, even those islets vanished, leaving nothing but boundless blue. Fortunately, we had brought sufficient supplies of fresh water and food, and were in no danger of dying from thirst or starvation.\n\nWe sailed for 79 days without sight of land. We were originally planning on turning back at that point, but to our surprise, on the 80th day, in the middle of the ocean, we were attacked. A group of bandits riding on the backs of giant birds blocked our path and asked us for potatoes. If you wish to know just how gargantuan those birds were, I can tell you that each of their feathers was as thick as the Ocean Pillars. With absolutely no hope of resisting, all we could do was fall to our knees and pray to Sebastos to deliver us, to let us live another day, and we swore to never again travel so recklessly, or write baffling believe-it-or-not travelogues. But in a flash, faster than words could describe, warriors riding Blubberbeasts surged up from beneath the sea's surface, each Blubberbeast larger than fifty Sumpter Beasts, their entire bodies draped in armor made of crystals, the scales of dragons, and cabbages, and they tore into the massive birds, biting them until they cried for their mommies and daddies, and soon they fled without a trace.\n\nIt was only then that we noticed that the appearance of those knights was completely different from that of us humans. They were more like bipedal vishaps. With those eyes of his, glowing with their strange light, the leader of the knights spent some time sizing us up, before casually speaking with winged words: \"Dear guests, are you merchants from Serenum?\"\n\nWe had not the slightest clue what kind of place \"Serenum\" was, so we told him the whole story, that we were seafarers from Remuria, and wanted to see what the end of the ocean looked like."},{"id":"Book803","title":"Book803","filename":"Book803_EN.txt","text":"Hearing our words, he burst into laughter, and he laughed so hard that even the sailfin on his back shook. As he howled with laughter, he managed to say that there's no such place as \"Remuria,\" merely a fake history invented by the southern barbarians who, not having their own civilization, created a fictional empire that simply didn't exist. We said that no, we were Remurians, and he guffawed even louder, and asked us to provide some kind of reliable historical data or archaeological evidence that could prove Remuria really exists. We simply could not produce the proofs, and he assured us that these sorts of strange fantasies were not illegal in their lands, and so long as we did not eat Sunsettias in public, we would still be honored guests in their Empire of Solaris. He went on, saying that based on our clothing, we probably weren't secret agents of the rebel army, but were likely traveling traders from Hyperborea. Their empire was currently in a state of civil war, and they hoped we could assist them in defeating said rebels.\n\nIt turned out that the Solaris Empire has very advanced technology, and some decades ago, a philosopher named Lucilius invented a way for some people to obtain extraordinary abilities far exceeding those of ordinary mortals. But it came at a price. Their appearance would change to be unlike those of ordinary people. Some believed that this practice destroyed the purity of humanity, and those with special powers had but two options: to be slaves, or to be destroyed utterly. And so the two sides quickly came to blows, and it was a fight to the death, with oceans of blood being spilled.\n\nI comforted him on the spot, telling him that in my opinion, this type of thing has been happening since ancient times. I could think of at least twenty plays on the spot, each revolving around this exact theme — this too was a reflection of just how the arts in Remuria were flourishing. Pisculentum's Terentius at once praises humanity as being equal yet powerful creatures, while also describing how only a small number of people innately possess special powers, and has them go off and conquer and destroy all others, no? I recommended they just stop researching technology to alter humanity, and instead focus their efforts on technology to alter Blubberbeasts, as Blubberbeasts are far more likable than humans. He said he would consider my wise suggestion, but that the more pressing matter was exterminating the despicable traitors. So long as we were willing to lend a helping hand, he would give us the most powerful Imperial Blubberbeast mounts to ride, and we would lead thirteen of his legions, each with a million soldiers, for a total of 13 million soldiers, and outflank the enemy to their left. As he had saved us from a rebel attack, we assented to his request.\n\nDear readers, everything I described above I saw with my own eyes! Not a word of it is false! As for the war that followed, it was even more unbelievable. I remember a blind slave who followed us singing thusly:\n\n\"Sing, O musician, sing of the rage of the Blubberbeast which brought countless ills!\"\n\nAnd just like that, the army of Blubberbeasts rolled forward, swallowing everything in its path like all-devouring flames, and the earth trembled and shook beneath their flippers. We arrayed our forces in formation upon the plains, and the leading officer prayed to their god before drawing taut a bowstring and loosing, sending a dog hurtling towards the rebel forces. The sound of the silver bow was unmanning to all who heard. But the rebels were not to be outdone, and they sent forth five million giants armed to the teeth. These giants were enormous, each dozens of times larger than the golems made by Sebastos's own hand, and they were said to be the reinforcements that the rebels had adjured forth from the seafloor. Though these giants each had but one eye — well, such things are quite normal, after all, the giants of which Pacuvius wrote are all like this — they had exceptional eyesight, and at the command of the rebel leader, they began to hurl Bulle Fruit at our troops with astonishing accuracy. These fruits would burst upon impact with the ground, spitting out masses of bubbles. Should you be touched by a bubble, you would float high up into the sky, until you flew straight into the sun. That is why the sun and Bulle Fruit have a similar color.\n\nAs for the war's conclusion, respected playwrights throughout history virtually never write of such things — they wish to leave enough space for future stories.

Finally, we arrived at a tall wall in the middle of the sea, stretching out of sight, high up into the sky. Countless densely packed human figures were suspended from the wall, and though they had neither bodies nor muscles, their forms could clearly be seen. All on this earth who speak lies, or pen falsehoods in their writings, will be hung from this wall to receive judgment after their death. As for who built this wall, or what lies beyond it, I do not know, for everything in this travelogue is completely true, and thus we had no way to get close to the wall. Hence, we promptly began rowing backward with all haste, doing our utmost to flee that place, and I hope to never again get anywhere close to it.\n\nThat evening, we arrived in a stretch of calm seas, close to a rather small island. Our freshwater supplies were nearly exhausted, so we made landfall in the hopes of replenishing them. It was then that every member of our party smelled a strange yet rich fragrance, and even the finest perfumes of Capitolium paled in comparison. It turns out that the island was inhabited, and they had even built a prosperous polis — everything in the city was made of gold, and was surrounded by a series of twelve walls, each wall constructed of a different kind of precious gemstone: The first was made of amethyst, the second of purple agate, the third of jadeite, the fourth of rubellite, the fifth of jasper, the sixth of topaz, the seventh of ruby, the eighth of cornelian, the ninth of emerald, the tenth of chrysoprase, the eleventh of sapphire, and the twelfth of jade. A great moat surrounded the city walls, a few hundred meters wide, and the fluid flowing therein was not water, but fresh milk, and that which swam within were pickled fish, already fully cured, ready to eat upon capture.\n\nThe residents of the island seemed to all be women, and each and every one was dressed elegantly, their faces comely and youthful. They approached us one after the other, taking the initiative and hugging us by way of welcome. The name of the island is Amoria, and they said it means \"love.\" They eagerly invited us into their homes as guests, and said they'd give us countless treasures as gifts, enough for us to buy all of Machimos. I began to feel a faint sense of unease — for could people who fawn over strangers so exist outside of the books of Ennius? But my companions were all quite familiar with those classic tales, and so found nothing strange at all about this, and followed them back to their homes. I had no choice but to feign delight on one hand, while secretly bringing with me the war booty the Solarians had presented me with: a Bulle Fruit. I followed one of the women back to her home, and once inside, I looked around carefully, and just as I expected, there were human bones all around. I promptly fished out the Bulle Fruit and took aim at her, demanding she tell me just what was going on. But she only laughed uproariously, turning into a pool of water and disappearing in the blink of an eye.\n\nI immediately gathered all my companions, and we fled back to our ship before we had a chance to gather any fresh water.

However, they worship not a specific figurehead with a presence in this world — such as one of The Seven — but elemental power itself in a more abstract sense. For instance, some hilichurl tribes in Mondstadt revere Anemo just as their human counterparts do, but they do not recognize the Anemo Archon Barbatos. Instead, they worship the power of Anemo itself. Hilichurls holding different elemental beliefs often live together in the same tribe. An individual hilichurl's elemental affiliation can be deduced from the designs on their masks and the color of their body paint.\n\nFirsthand observations indicate that the Shaman, responsible for organizing offerings and worship ceremonies for the tribe, applies a colored dye to their hair and skin, with the color representing the element they worship. Shamans are dressed and adorned more ornately than ordinary tribe members, but owing to the limited intelligence of the hilichurls it is highly doubtful that any of the fine ornaments worn are crafted by their own hand.\n\nThe Shaman is the spiritual leader of his tribe. He leads them in song and dance during worship, singing hymns of praise to the elements. If there is leftover meat from the hunt, the hilichurls place it on the altar, raw, as a sacrifice. Even though they accumulate ample Mora, precious stones, and other items of value through exploring, looting, mugging and other means, it would appear that raw meat alone is considered a sufficient sacrifice.\n\nIt would appear that the hilichurls possess no concept of either the past or future, living only in the present. They do not intentionally store up food for survival, nor do they commemorate their deceased forebears. Though crude attempts at something like calligraphy have been widely observed within their camps, closer inspection reveals these markings to be nothing more than botched imitations of what they have seen in ancient ruins, possessing no originality whatsoever.

They have built a boar-rearing pen in the center of their settlement and assigned a swineherd to watch over it. Over a natural stove made with a Pyro Slime, they cook boar stew in a single, large pot from which each tribe member feeds according to their needs.\nThe most striking feature of this tribe is its sizable combat arena. Those who set foot in the arena are understood to be accepting an open invitation to engage in combat, and those subsequently ousted from it face being mocked by the entire tribe.\n\nThe Sleeper tribe is prone to sleeping at every opportunity. They have built themselves an environment especially conducive to sleep, consisting of simple, wooden huts furnished with soft animal hide for beds. They are the most cunning and devious of the hilichurl tribes, and their above-average mental capacity can perhaps be attributed to the superior sleep quality they enjoy.\n\nThe practices of the Eclipse tribe are the most occult of any in Mondstadt. They concern themselves neither with brains nor brawn, but with occult power. Distinct from the elemental powers worshiped by their peers, the object of their worship is a crude symbol that appears to represent an eclipsed sun. Their shamans are more powerful than those of the other tribes.

For they knew the extent of their own degeneracy, and wished not for their deeds to be held to scrutiny by the annals of history alongside tales of heroes' honor and glory.\n\nBut the winds of history blow strong, and ultimately no wall could be built tall enough to stay them. This work is a collection of all poems, songs, and legends that have survived from the aristocratic period, interspersed with archaeologists' commentary. Its purpose is to provide a new account of Mondstadt's history from the Age of Kings all the way through to the fall of the Aristocracy. A degree of historical inaccuracy is inevitable, given that certain details are impossible to verify. We can but humbly hope that this work might elucidate the past for those who come after us, or perhaps inspire them to further investigate the facts of history on their own.\n\nThis work is divided into three sections: Section 1, \"The Stormlord of the Tower and the Kingwolf of Boreas,\" covers the struggle between the Kings of Ice and Frost prior to Barbatos' arrival. Section 2, \"The Cultivation of Mondstadt,\" covers Mondstadt's ancestors, including the aristocrats' predecessors, in the period during which agriculture developed. Section 3, \"Tyrants, Heirs, and Rebels,\" covers the long reign of the Aristocracy in Mondstadt.\n\nThe reader may wish for this work to serve as a cautionary tale to future generations. In fact, it was compiled with no such ambition in mind. The freedom bestowed upon us by Barbatos is also the freedom that allows us to cast off the shackles of the past in search of the truth. My only hope is that this work, in a spirit of openness and truth, may finally share with the reader those stories which it was forbidden to share in the past."},{"id":"Book830","title":"Book830","filename":"Book830_EN.txt","text":"...\n███████\n█████mechanical puppets ask the protagonist what she wishes█████\nbut she only wishes to stand on stage█████\n██\n4. ██Stage\n██████her circuits have aged, and her dance steps are stilted, her movements clumsy██████\n████████████focus the audience's attention on████\nSome cursory movements to get the point across will suffice.

Her face... I have never seen anything like it. Even the purest of crystals could not be fashioned into the likeness of such skin, nor could the purest of turquoise be carved into such eyes. Yet for reasons I cannot explain, that face, which should have been the very picture of beauty, was... so nauseatingly repulsive.\n\nI did not know who — nor even what — she was. I opened my mouth and wanted to beg her, beg her to save me, yet my lips... had been burned beyond all recognition, and I could not utter even a single word.\n\nShe smiled, a smile laced with a cruel and arrogant malice. She held my face in her hand, and from those turquoise eyes, golden tears fell into mine.\n\nAnd then I saw it.\n\nA colossal creation, far larger than the rolling mountains, shining with a brilliance more dazzling than obsidian, floating in the sky like a volcanic cloud. Around it circled countless giant metal birds, greedily sucking away at its dark blood. I saw shadows driven by flowing flames, climbing high from distant horizons to the moon up in the sky, from which tremors and sighs were sent out unimaginable distances via but a single string woven from gold and white copper. She sneered by my ear, as if all humanity had achieved up to this point was nothing more than child's play, as utterly inconsequential as the doings of ants, of beings capable only of crawling around beneath the heavens, trembling away while seeking their inglorious graves. And what they fought, what they were pitted up against, was an inveterate foe as formidable as an entire world. Through those turquoise eyes, those pupils whose beauty was almost terrifying, I saw naught but endless, unfathomable darkness and void; a space that no language could describe, unlike anything I have ever seen in the brief few decades of my transient life. So it was that I began to scream, stumbling as I crawled along that path, but even my blood-curdling screams were drowned out by her laughter, and dissipated without a trace.\n\nWhen I next woke, I was lying here alone. I did not dare look back, lest those profane, forbidden things, those things that no person should ever know, might catch and tear me to pieces. The others must all have died, perishing in the flames of Och-Kan's fire.\n\nPerhaps those were not her tears. Perhaps they were simply drops of water that fell from that giant, grotesque stone statue behind her. Perhaps there was nothing in the fire, and that woman was just an illusion of my delirium, something I imagined as I stood on the precipice of death. But now, none of that matters; for I am still alive, and that is all that counts.\n\nOch-Kan thinks that the secret passages of the ineffable city are now unbeknownst to all but him, and that his reign will last for a thousand years. He is mistaken; for at most, it will last a thousand weeks."},{"id":"Book83","title":"Book83","filename":"Book83_EN.txt","text":"May the gentle breeze of Barbatos carry words of enlightenment and deliver them into the gaze of my readers. And may the wind of freedom forever prevail in Mondstadt.\n\nThe story of the Gunnhildr Clan begins in legend, three thousand years ago during the war between the Lord of the Tower, Decarabian, and the King of the North Wind, Andrius. It was a time when Mondstadt was a frozen wasteland, and Gunnhildr was about to become the strongest leader her nomadic clan had ever seen.\n\nGunnhildr's father, the then-leader of the clan, had once served under Decarabian. He served until he found the despotic rule of the aloof and selfish king to be more than he could bear, whereupon he led his clan outside of the city where ferocious winds howled without mercy. But life in the wasteland beyond the city gates was harsh and unforgiving. Though they had escaped the wrath of a tyrant, they were now faced with the wrath of relentless and all-engulfing blizzards.\n\nJust when all hope seemed lost for the wandering clan, a spirit from the midst of the myriad winds heard Gunnhildr's prayers. The sincere plea of a clan chief's young daughter joined with a people's cry for help, a cry that the blizzard had all but drowned out, and became a faith. The faith gathered in front of the wind spirit like water flowing into a spring and became the source from which the wind spirit drew its power. The wind spirit used this power to make a small shelter for the clan, and bestowed upon the clan chief's daughter the power to protect.\n\nAfter her father's death, Gunnhildr took his place as the clan's leader. She also became its first priestess. From that day forth, she protected her clan faithfully. When the Anemo Archon Barbatos challenged the aloof and selfish king Decarabian's rule, Gunnhildr led her people to make a stand against the Archon's fury. But when Barbatos finally fought through the ferocious winds and freed the tyrant's subjects, she was also the one who decorated the victorious Anemo Archon with laurels.\n\nIn later times, after Barbatos had departed, a class of aristocrats emerged across the land. These rulers, who were possessed of divine power, would become corrupted and turn to tyranny themselves a thousand years later, but none had the ability to predict the distant future. Not even Barbatos himself.\n\nGunnhildr's descendants were themselves a prominent clan within the Aristocracy. But unlike the evil and scheming Lawrence Clan, the Gunnhildrs upheld their legacy of protecting Mondstadt that was enshrined in their motto, \"for Mondstadt, as always,\" doing everything within their power to protect its people. During the later struggle to overthrow the Aristocracy, they took the side of the people of Mondstadt. For this reason, they were spared the sentence of exile that was imposed on the rest of the Aristocracy.\n\nToday, the Gunnhildr Clan is a source of many brave knights and outstanding clergy members that serve in the Knights of Favonius. If history can teach us anything at all about the future, perhaps it is that the Gunnhildr Clan will continue honoring the legacy of its ancestors and its duty to the Anemo Archon: to protect Mondstadt, the land and all who inhabit it, forever."},{"id":"Book840","title":"Book840","filename":"Book840_EN.txt","text":"...My burns have now completely healed.

These misunderstandings are not conducive to conquering and pacifying them, nor are they beneficial to the long-term well-being of the empire.\n\nFor these reasons, I, Hirtius, the Vicarius of Legio VI Rithimi Versi, in accordance with the exalted Harmost Euergetia's universally known benevolence and authority, hereby faithfully record all I know for posterity, so that future successors may fulfill their duty to safeguard the northern border with less trouble.\n\nSociety\n\nThe social structures of different chiefdoms vary dramatically. Most chiefdoms are still in the stage of rudimentary clan-based societies, with councils composed of clan chiefs holding the highest authority. However, the moniker \"tribe\" has long ceased to be an accurate descriptor for some chiefdoms. Though many are loath to admit this, we must face the fact they have broken free from primal barbarism.\n\nFor example, before the polis of Lugdunensis was razed by Legio V, its population exceeded (...). As the trade hub of many northern chiefdoms, its degree of prosperity could be favorably compared to (...). The ruler of the area did not call themselves a \"Chieftain,\" but a \"Holy King,\" and they believed their authority to rule came from an ancient sword bestowed upon them by the \"Mother of Many Springs.\" Naturally, any rational citizen knows that strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from melody and harmony, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.\n\nAnother example: (...) is ruled by a council of astrologists, and they use (...) to set apart young children with elemental affinity, raising them to become (...), and these \"people\" can nearly rival our legions in battle.\n(Note by Marius Servius: The city mentioned here has already been subjugated and razed by the exalted Harmost Boethius, its name erased from memory.)\n\nIn the past, the conquest of tribes still in a primitive state could be completed simply by dealing with the clan elders of each clan. A few decades ago, the exalted Harmost Aurelius successfully concluded his northern campaign through such methods: Without even resorting to violence, simply by dispatching legionnaires to announce the conquest, the various insular tribes on those remote islands were incorporated into the empire's territory. However, following the conquest of Aremorica, such tribes grew fewer and fewer. Different methods ought to be used to pacify different chiefdoms. Just as the exalted Harmost Euergetia once said, It is because they are ignorant savages by nature, that we must first understand them before they can understand us...\n\n(The following pages have been erased, and cannot be read.)\n\nBeliefs\n\nToday, the belief that the barbarians of the north worship a false god (or evil god) known as the \"Mistress of All Waters\" is widespread. However, this is a fiction created as a result of the conquest of Aremorica — Its leader had forced other chiefdoms to acknowledge that their gods were all aspects of the \"Mistress of All Waters,\" regardless of what god they originally worshipped or what names they had.\n\nIn other words, the barbarians of the northern border region do not have a single centralized belief system. Even to this day, they do not have a unified understanding of the concept of the \"Mistress of All Waters.\" The leader of Aremorica seemed not to mind this point, as she only demanded they worship the same name without prescribing the contents of their beliefs.\n\nRegardless, blood and barbarism pervade their belief systems. Some scholars believe this is because they never received a response from the gods, and can only resort to increasingly violent and extreme sacrifices to prop up their false beliefs.\n\nShowing them the mercy of the Sebastos is meaningless, for mercy is regarded as weakness by the savages. The correct approach is to point out to them that the Sebastos can easily defeat their false gods, and only the Sebastos is powerful enough to be worthy of worship...\n\n(The following pages have been erased, and cannot be read.)\n\nAremorica\n\nOnce an obscure and unknown tribe, but today the center of power in the northern border region.\n\nIts former ruler, Cunoricus, bent the knee to the empire some twenty years ago. As for its current ruler — the infamous Erinnyes — we know little indeed. From captured slaves, we have learned that she is not the heir of Cunoricus. The latter did originally have a son as well, named Caius. However, we are unsure when and how she became the ruler of Aremorica.\n\nRegardless of how she claims to have been blessed by the false god, she has never demonstrated any abilities surpassing those to be expected of an ordinary mortal. Everything she has done so far amounts to nothing more than using insidious plots and base treachery to commit abhorrent crimes against the Empire and its citizens. Only those who are utterly helpless, teetering on the brink of death would choose to believe in a woman proclaiming to be able to hear the will of the gods and flock to her banner. Just as the exalted Harmost Euergetia said, she simply does not believe in any god at all — for none with faith would commit such atrocities in the name of a god.\n\n(Note by Marius Servius: The name \"Erinnyes\" is suspected to be the result of a careless error when it was first transcribed, for this name has no meaning in their language. In the script of the people of bygone times, the symbol for the sound \"gh\" looks quite similar to \"y,\" and so was copied as such. There is precedent for similar mistakes. The proper pronunciation of the name should be \"Errighenth of Aremorica\" — in the language of the people of bygone times, \"Er\" signifies \"high\" while \"Righenth\" would be the feminine case of \"ruler.\"\nFrom this perspective, the name is perhaps not her praenomen, but rather her title. However, since many scholars already refer to her as \"Erinnyes,\" there is no need for me to assume the authority to revise it.)"},{"id":"Book875","title":"Book875","filename":"Book875_EN.txt","text":"...The matter of paramount importance is to be able to properly distinguish the different categories of music, so as not to create misunderstandings caused by confusion regarding the meaning of words...\n\n...There are three categories of music in this world.

We will discuss that in detail later...\n\n...The Musica Instrumentalis is the most fundamental music, and there is no need to elaborate on it.

The warmongering gods made it so, for the vanquished were crushed under the rocks, and there they rotted and became soil. Thus were they returned to the cycle of Elements, which doth span both Heaven and Earth, and which knows no end. But some souls held on to their hatred and took on flesh once more as daemons. The daemons rose up in anger, giving rise to a miasma, which in turn engendered all manner of plagues, monsters and other perverse evils. They starved the earth and churned the waters, and wrought devastation on the people. Therefore, it is said: The daemonic is the shadow of the divine.\n\n\"Liyue suffered many outbreaks of disease in ancient times. Some say this was caused by the chaos of the relentless warring between gods. The defeated were squashed beneath the rocks of the earth, where they decomposed and became soil, and finally re-entered the everlasting elemental cycle. Some of the gods' souls were filled with bitterness at their fate, and refused to suffer it any longer. Their bitterness materialized and became evil monsters. The monsters' rage manifested itself in the form of diseases, monster infestations, and all kinds of other strange occurrences. The monsters ravaged the land and turned it into a wilderness, and unleashed all manner of evil upon the rivers and seas. They inflicted untold suffering on the people. Hence, what we call monsters are in fact physical manifestations of the resentment of gods defeated in war.\"\n\nRex Lapis summoned yakshas unto him to purge the daemons. Illuminated beasts of dreadful appearance and warlike temperament were they, and no brutality did they spare in their duty to defend. Of the many, five were the strongest: Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus. Wherever battle took Rex Lapis, so too did they follow, until the plague was purged. The five are known unto mortals as \"The Yakshas.\"\n\n\"Rex Lapis summoned yakshas to help him destroy the monsters. The yakshas were illuminated beasts of Liyue. Ferocious and intimidating to behold, they were violent by nature and formidable in battle, ready to kill mercilessly to defend Rex Lapis' rule. Among the yakshas, five were known as the strongest: Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus. The five followed Rex Lapis into battle countless times, finally wiping out the evil at its source. They became known throughout the world simply as 'The Yakshas'.\"\n\n\"The Yakshas\" were guardians of Rex Lapis for years without measure, and the evils they vanquished were incalculable. Yet, mighty though they were, beyond the torment that betide all who face war the yakshas were not, and they became afflicted. Some were given unto their rage, others unto a madness which fear mongered. Many turned to the slaughter of their own, others were bewitched by shadows of the soul. After a millennium did fate present itself unto them, and it was such: three of the five perished, the fourth vanished, and all of the myriad shared the fate of the three or the fourth. The fifth alone prevailed, and the fifth was Alatus.\n\n\"'The Yakshas' faithfully protected Rex Lapis and pacified all manner of catastrophes in the world. This continued for many years. But there came a day when the yakshas, despite their might, found that their deeds had taken their toll, and that the remnants of divine bitterness had begun to poison them. Some descended into a blind rage of a kind that cannot be put into words, or were driven by ineffable fear to equally indescribable madness. Some turned on each other and destroyed themselves. Some were lost to delusions of the mind. After a thousand years' scourges, three of the five were slain, and one disappeared. Many other yakshas of unknown name also either died or fled. In the end, only one of the five, Alatus, survived.\"\n\nAlatus is the Golden-Winged King who is also the Conqueror of Demons. None knows whence he came, nor whither he went. Only at springtime, during the offering of lanterns at night, might the people see the glow at Guyun and declare: \"Behold, the Vigilant Yaksha ends the dominion of daemons!\" Or they might hear the sound of a flute amongst the marsh reeds, but find none who play the flute, and thus declare: \"Hark, the yaksha calls to summon his old friends to their homeland.\"\n\n\"Alatus is also known as the Golden-Winged King, or alternatively as the Conqueror of Demons. Nobody knows where he came from, and nobody knows where he went. In spring of each year, when the Lantern Rite festival arrives, Liyue people will gaze at the glow in the air above Guyun Stone Forest, and say: 'Behold, the Guardian Yaksha ends the dominion of demons.' Some hear a sound like a flute coming from Dihua Marsh, but when they enter the marsh there is no flutist to be found. They say: 'Hark, the yaksha calls to summon his old friends to their homeland.'\"\n\nThus, divine endowment doth carry with it that ultimate and unbreakable trial: to lose kin, friend, or ally, to face the impossibility of redemption, to burn in everlasting anger and know no respite. To become the foe of an ancient evil was to abandon hope of both reward and resolution in his endeavors, and his torment was that of the preta, which is to be without satiety after ten thousand fates.\n\n\"For this reason, it is said that the wages of being blessed with supernatural power is a destiny of hardship and eventual destruction. For the yaksha lost all his friends, family, and those he fought alongside. He built up an incalculable karmic debt from the violent deeds his life necessitated, and the consequence was a heart filled with darkness and hatred from which there was no rest. There was no reward to be gained from making an enemy of his own bitterness and hatred from the old days, nor was there any escape from the unbearable suffering. The torment ate away at his heart like an insatiable wolf, and an infinite number of lifetimes could have done nothing to reduce it.\""},{"id":"Book890","title":"Book890","filename":"Book890_EN.txt","text":"<image name=UI_TRPG_Liney/>\nCharacter Name: \"Lyney\"\nCharacter Identity: Marechaussee Hunter\nBackground:\nThe adopted son of a Marechaussee Hunter.

And actually-actually, the green moonlight was the result of the moon's physical composition, the distance between the planet and its moon, atmospheric scattering, and other factors.\n\nAnyway, so the little witch was soaring upon her broom beneath the blood-green moon, and then, she met a young lady who claimed to be a \"fortune teller.\"\n\"I wish to become a witch's familiar,\" said the young lady.\nBut before they could even consider that, the little witch had something to ask: \"Can fortune tellers read the skeins of fate?\"\nThe fortune teller then explained the underlying principles. Put simply, it's something like this:\nIn our world, the stars are the heavenly strings by which humans are bound. But in other worlds, the subjects of astrological study are the solar ecliptic energies, the various lunar energies of the satellites, the will-energy of the celestial rulers of the planets, the scattered interference energy of distant stars, and the dark energy that suffuses the pitch-black cosmos. Of course, it's not like these things don't exert influence on our planet — they have merely been greatly weakened by a giant sky-shroud. As such, astrology on other worlds is far more abstract than that which is practiced in ours.\nBy the way, other planets refer to an actual celestial bodies as an \"archon\" and a theorized one as a \"virtual.\" The planet the little witch was on was no exception.\nYou see, we also call a will that comes down from the heavens an \"archon.\" They are normally planets that have sentient life on them, and they number seven, and therefore they are called the \"seven archons.\" As for the virtuals, their number varies between one, two, and four. The planet the little witch was one may well have been one. And in the case of such a world, the \"virtual\" would be the \"dark sun.\"\nAstrologists and diviners are, in essence, performing weight calculations on the sky-shroud, the cosmos, and the \"archon\" and \"virtual\" celestial bodies, before deducing individual developmental tendencies from world to world. But the relative weight of the sky-shroud over our planet is just way, way too great, and so, investigating it already allows us to obtain very precise results. As for the world the little witch and astrologist were on, they would have to go through the entire formula.\n\nAfter the little witch finished listening, she was very impressed by the fortune teller's learning and technique.\nNow they could speak of the matter of familiarhood. To be a witch's familiar was to share in her magic, and with magic, one could peer into more destinies. That said, becoming a familiar could have unforeseen side effects — it was hard to say what might happen.\nYes! That's what the blood-green moon means: great change, which can't be judged as good or ill by the outcome. See how it all comes together? We didn't go off-topic!\n\n\"It is a shame that I am still not a great witch. I can't make you my familiar yet, \" said the little witch.\n\"I know of another way to establish a contract with a witch. It seems we must resort to using it,\" said the young lady.\nThis was the night bathed in blood-green moonlight, and it was also, coincidentally, the witches' Night Carnival.\n\nBy the way, the Night Carnival is an ancient, taboo ceremony. Legend has it that at such times, the witches' magical powers are at their apex. They hold rituals in secret, offering sacrifices and keeping the bonfires burning through the night. This tradition had been forgotten in the westernmost parts of the magical continent but, for some reason, it had been revived within the deep woods. Normally, this was an event that only great witches or figures greater still could be invited to, or invite others to attend.\nIn practice, though, participation in a Carnival had a direct relation with a witch's romantic or marital status.\n\nIn any case, for some totally unknown reason, the astrologist knew all about witches while the witch knew nothing about astrologists at all. The point is, they decided to go and check out the Night Carnival. Let's just go with it being a way to deal with the anxiety the little witch felt over not being able to find the \"undying fire.\"\n\nUnder the blood-green moon, the great witches danced around the bonfire.\nThe little witch and the young astrologist hid in the shadows of trees that grew so thick that even dense clouds couldn't compare, and even the bonfire could not illuminate them.\n\n\"We just need to wait till the day after the ancient, forbidden night of revelry, when the dawn light first breaks and the various great witches depart.\n\"In the grey embers will be a flame that never dies. When a mortal takes this flame and offers it up, that is equivalent to signing a contract with a witch,\" said the young lady.\n\"Does this method always work?\" The little witch asked.\n\"It's possible a witch could reject the contract, but witches do so love their spirit mediums, and I'm not afraid of becoming a fearsome creature,\" the young lady replied, her voice thick with yearning.\n\"In that case, isn't this an 'undying fire'?\" Dark thoughts came into the little witch's mind. \"What if I took that flame for my own?\"\n\nAnd so, under the blood-green moonlight, the great witches sang their song:\n\"If all things a witch's opera be,\"\n\"Then nothing true worth mourning would the world ever see.\"\n\"Our festival has come to a fruitful end.\"\n\"The story shall not stay its feet,\"\n\"And every night hence shall also be the witches' night.\"\n\nA sense of shame surged forth within the little witch as she listened from the shadows — it wasn't out of worry that those present, great witches and greater still, might include her teacher, school principal, instructors, or anything like that. She knew everyone at her school, and she was sure no one familiar was present.\nBy the way, while the official rules at the school she attended were lax when it came to governing teachers and their students, students of similar age would still be ranked against each other. Students of different teachers were also permitted to interact outside of classes. The creation of this system could be traced back to the rise of the Western witches, long, long ago. They did not shy away from exchanging secret hexes and rituals for their mutual benefit, which would also result in their swift rise in those days. Of course, the organization that the little witch belonged to was a direct successor of these Western witches. Also, this blurb definitely wasn't just added in here because I forgot about this worldbuilding earlier.\n\nBack to the story. She said to the fortune teller:\n\"Since we have this opportunity, go bravely forth, then! Once dawn comes, take that fire. If you should be so unfortunate as to become a monster, I will give you a quick end. You will not suffer.\"\nAs a gift to commemorate this friendship, the young lady gave her treasured crystal ball to the little witch.\n\"This crystal ball feels joy for all known destined paths, and its heart breaks for all unrevealed tragedies. If you ever feel lost, allow it to be your oracle!\"\n\nActually, there's a story behind this crystal ball. It—"},{"id":"Book908","title":"Book908","filename":"Book908_EN.txt","text":"In her travels, the little witch encountered a group of people getting ready to kill demon kings.\nShe decided to join them and go kill some demon kings.\nThey told her: The more demon kings you kill, the greater your witch's power will grow.\nThis is, in fact, true.\nThen, they encountered a mimic demon king.\nAfter this whole affair, the little witch would write a \"Demon King-Slaying Chronicle\" each time she hunted one.\n\nThey encountered the mimic demon king in a run-down old house. At first, no one knew what was going on, assuming that the place had just gone moldy.\nAfter breathing the mold spores in, her companions turned into the following respectively: A shoddy-looking ancient robot (which the little witch found really ugly and not up to snuff when compared to alchemy), a beautiful young maiden (this team member was originally male, leading the witch to initially wonder if this was some inversion of biological sequential hermaphroditism), and a pirate (she had no idea about this one).\nAfter some time, everyone in the squad developed identity disorders. Considering that her three companions appeared to be of the same species, they should not have exhibited such different natures, while the symptoms were, by contrast, so similar.\nThe little witch discovered that the mold had its own consciousness, and had a power that allowed similar lifeforms to turn into their ideal state. She did not change because she was already very pleased with herself.\nThe little witch decided to test the mold's unique properties.\nShe tried ingesting parts of it, finding it to be edible and without any side effects. Thus, it might have been a miscategorization to call it a mold, but since the mold in blue mold cheese could also be eaten, she decided to continue using that label. Something worth noting was that after a chunk had been cut away, the other mold threads would immediately disappear. Possibly a sign of a rudimentary collective intelligence.\nTo facilitate further communication, the little witch wanted to turn into mold — and so she did.\nAs it turned out, the mold colony only sent strange biological signals that needed deciphering. Through repeated observations, it seemed that their level of collective intelligence might be lower than she had previously thought.\nIn the end, the mold committed suicide. The little witch deciphered its way of communicating communications, and as it turned out, the colony experienced dissonance in self-perception and self-dissociation when it looked upon the little witch who had become just like them. The signals they sent had in fact been philosophical speculation \"Who is me, and who am I?\" Its intelligence was thus much higher than expected.\nHer friends recovered, and told the little witch that this was the mimic demon king. It was a species of demon king, in the same taxonomic class as standard demon kings but not in the same order.\nIt was a shame. She wished she had a chance to observe more and make some more records.\n\nThen, they encountered a chipmunk demon king, which her comrades had claimed beforehand was also a species of demon king.\nIt was classified as belonging to the same class and superorder as a standard demon king but was part of a different grandorder.\nThe chipmunk demon king looked very fierce indeed, and the little witch suspected that this aggressiveness stemmed from behaviors acquired during the gestation period and while nurturing their offspring.\nInfiltrating its old nest, they found that it was male. One of her companions was eaten.\nIt turned out that it simply had a bad temper. The little witch decided to report the findings of this investigation to prevent the tragedy from repeating itself.\nThey attempted to feed the chipmunk demon king seeds to lure it out. They lost another companion in the process.\nIt seemed that this creature was not a vegetarian at all.\nHer final companion fled. having deduced from the pattern of events thus far that he was next on the chopping block. This was an incomplete logical induction — both the process and conclusion were mistaken.\nEventually, she used high-grade boar meat to lure the chipmunk demon king into a trap. The creature's fat and fur made it resilient to fire and freezing. Though she had never dissected one, results indicated that it also had an organ enabling it to breathe underwater.\nA complete vacuum was used to dispatch it in the end. It seems that it still required aerobic respiration.\n\nMany demon kings seem very powerful, but they all have their weaknesses. The same is true for alchemical lifeforms.\nFinally, the little witch had to face a standard demon king, a great demon king of the primate order."},{"id":"Book909","title":"Book909","filename":"Book909_EN.txt","text":"So, the little witch found the great demon king. I'm sure you all remember that killi— defeating more demon kings causes witches to grow stronger. As such, the little witch was actually already amazingly powerful now! The great demon king was simply no match for her.\n\"Can you really kill a being that looks like a human and has intelligence?\" Shouted the great demon king in desperation.\n\"You're right. I didn't really intend to do anything to you anyway,\" said the little witch. \"I've never forgotten that my goal is to find the 'undying fire.' Researching, observing, and defeating demon kings was never even a means to the end, but rather just the building of a basic level of power.\"\nThen, she used — sorry, I don't know magic or mysticism — some super powerful awesome technique to bind the great demon king, and brought it back to the largest nearby city.\n\nAs a trainee of the Western witches who had come out to take her exam, she naturally had credentials that proved her identity. This provided her convenient passage through the many mortal kingdoms — such things were also proven to be immensely hard to forge, thus avoiding the possibility of any cliche plotlines.\nThis actually presented the mayor of the city with a conundrum — ah yes, this is a good time to say that this nation was a loose confederacy. And since this was a mayor, there was no aristocracy or hereditary titles — for the handling of this great demon king was truly quite tricky.\nI'm sure you all remember that the dominant race of this planet was the Nephilim, a hybrid of humans and gods? Right! So, the race of great demon king is actually the demon king class, and so demon kings were thus a type of Nephilim. And of course, since they were the dominant race, this meant that Nephilim were on the whole much stronger than normal humans — and since this setting for this world has hybrids of humans and gods, this meant that it has gods too.\nAnd taking a step back, the Nephilim also had a certain degree of legal immunity — If they had killed 5 humans or fewer, they couldn't be judged by human laws, and had to be repatriated to Nephilim lands. And as it happened, this great demon king had only stolen and eaten several thousand boars and chickens each.\n\nSo this was fast turning into a diplomatic and political issue. Of course, the mayor could just stick the Western witches with all the blame, but that would offend every witch on the continent.\nPlus, the mayor was also a good friend of the little witch. She would never do anything that would hurt the organization of witches as a whole.\nFollowing some diplomatic rhetoric, some policies to appease it, and an explanation of the pros and cons, the captured great demon king accepted that retribution should only be exacted on the party who had done the wrong, meaning that his ire was now narrowed to the little witch alone.\nBut he could not defeat her, so that was the end of that, really.\n\nFinally, I hope everyone remembers that crystal ball, because the little witch's goals had become foggy at this stage, so she decided to take it out and have a look at it."},{"id":"Book90","title":"Book90","filename":"Book90_EN.txt","text":"At the top of the stairs, a stone guardian watches over treasure buried in gravel.\n<image name=UI_Dailytask_1/>"},{"id":"Book910","title":"Book910","filename":"Book910_EN.txt","text":"A familiar face surfaced in the crystal ball. \"This is your magic teacher speaking.

She wanted to question her teacher face-to-face about why the test had ended, and why she was not to be permitted to become a witch. She wanted to throw things to the ground in front her teacher — though of course, she would only chuck the ones that could survive the impact and that she could practically lift herself while avoiding her teacher's favorite teacup. Of course, should the situation warrant it, she was even willing to smash her own second-favorite teacup to show how serious this all was. After all, she'd bought that one herself rather than it having been given to her by friends. She valued such gifts as much as the friends themselves, and would never use them as part of an emotional outburst.\n\n\"Octavia's back. Go catch up with her.\"\nThat was what her teacher said calmly the moment they saw each other again. In an instant, the emotions that the little witch had stored up, brewed, fermented, plotted, and rehearsed pouring out countless times vanished.\nOctavia was a good friend of hers, and a good friend also of the legendary old witch. Her home had been destroyed, but as she lacked the courage to fight back, she had taken up a life of eternal wandering.\nShe had seen many worlds, and had told the little witch many tales about the sky beyond the sky.\n\n\"The entire cosmos is going to die soon. Things peaked but not long ago, and are about to go south very fast.\" Octavia was sitting in a yard swathed in flowing sunlight, pouring tea into the teacups she and the little witch loved most.\nThe little witch pulled a chair up and sat in it. \"You returned so suddenly,\" she said, \"we didn't even prepare a chair for you. You're probably sitting in the old witch's chair now.\"\n\"Many stars across the cosmos have gone out. I do not know how much time is left,\" Octavia said, \"so I wanted to come back to see you.\"\n\"Is that why my teacher and the others stopped all the witch tests? Because you came back and told them this?\" The little witch asked.\n\"Perhaps. In such a world, all things lose meaning, and there is no longer any need for you to become a witch.\"\n\"Then I shan't be angry at my teacher any longer,\" the little witch said.\n\"But will you be mad at me? I caused you to lose your chance to become one,\" O said.\n\"I will, if you never return after leaving this time,\" came the little witch's reply. \"I'll go to the bedroom to get your chair.\"\n\"I can just sit in that old witch's chair, can't I? She's too old to get up and come sit in it nowadays.\"\n\"That's no good! That chair's hers, just as your chair's yours,\" the little witch argued her case earnestly with O. \"To each person a chair. That way, even if they are not present, their memories will be seated still. So we absolutely can't use the wrong chairs.\"\nOctavia smiled helplessly.\n\nAnd by way of apology for interrupting the process of the little witch becoming a proper one, she gave the latter a piece of news:\nSo\n\"The 'undying fire' really exists.

Even the memorial of the great witch she had so admired ended deserted, without her in attendance.\nWhatever they were, the point is that the little witch passed through all manner of haphazard trials and challenges and nonsensical stuff before she managed to arrive before the old witch. Actually, it's just that the little witch didn't think those experiences were worth talking about, nor did she know why anyone bothered spilling so much ink about all that earlier stuff. When all's said and done, the most important things were the witch's tea party and the goal she was pursuing.\nIn truth, she had already seen it before her journey began. In a sky as dark as a sack of coal — or perhaps a cavern, for as we all know, there is no difference between the two — there hung a star giving off a weak radiance, resisting the world's darkness as it encroached on every side. As the universe gradually grew dim, and all stars and stars known as suns were extinguished one by one, everyone agreed to call it the Star of Scorpio. The little witch remembered hearing about this during the witch's tea party, but she only remembered the name and nothing else.\nAnyway, the little witch came before the old witch, who was actually the Star of Scorpio, that which burned still, even at the end of all things. However, her flame was very weak now, barely a faint ember. The little witch held her hand, which had become as dry and brittle as a withered branch. She remembered that the old witch was once a little witch as well, with pale and tender hands that once elegantly held teacups. Those same hands had been used to bring forth much magic, kindling the flames on many worlds.\nThe little witch said:\n\"Looks like everyone doesn't want the flame to go out, and I get it. It can't be helped. The last time we said farewell — you were there too — the witches said that long-lived witches would lose many things as the years went by. Life, death, love, and hate would cease to have much meaning. But that isn't true. Those are just words they used to comfort the companions who departed before them. Witches, in fact, treasure every infinitesimal flame and light that shines in this dark world bereft of hope all the more. They hold even the shadows that these flames would cast dear.\n\"You often said that you weren't our equal, but I've always believed you to be the cutest, most powerful witch amongst us. You often said that you left little behind, but the stories you left to us hold countless worlds. Even should a hundred years pass, or a thousand, even if the apocalypse that a certain astrologer witch worried about comes, even if all the long-lived witches die, the little light that emanates from these little worlds will not grow dim. That's right. You were the greatest great witch — far greater than us all. I miss you. Farewell.\"\nThe old witch did not respond, for all that was left here was but an empty husk, no different from the many others that the little witch had encountered in her adventures — indeed, they were even made of the same basic material, with the only difference between those and this being the minuscule light of a flame.\nAnd so, the little witch took the flame that was burning the old witch and set out on her homeward journey. Anyway, let's stop the story here. The little witch's adventures would continue, though, for she had already decided to bring the old witch's fire across the universe, to light every last corner of time."},{"id":"Book913","title":"Book913","filename":"Book913_EN.txt","text":"On an afternoon much like many others, Perroux let out an extended yawn and was rubbing his eyes when he suddenly caught sight of a golden invitation lying silently in the flowerbed.\nSunlight illuminated the card's cover, and the words emblazoned upon it — \"To Monsieur Perroux\" — shone brighter than scattered Mora.\nHis eyes widened.\nHe was but the humblest of bellboys, greeting every visitor who came calling at the Master's door with a respectful \"Monsieur\" or \"Madame.\" This was the first time anyone had ever addressed him so politely as \"Monsieur Perroux\"!\nWho left it here? And without him ever noticing, too!\nHe blinked a few times, then blinked again, confirming over and over that it was not some iridescent trick of the light. Then, he opened the invitation...\n\"We are deeply grateful for the deliciousness you provided for us.

He came from a faraway kingdom in the north, and wore a coat of thick, well-groomed fur — perhaps you might even say over-groomed, in fact, for if you got close, you could even smell what he had eaten for his last meal (my cat is currently sitting on top of me, licking itself... has a really fishy smell...). There was a wisdom in his emerald-green eyes that was beyond anything common folk could hope to attain.\nThe kind-hearted townspeople welcomed the traveler warmly.

This notebook is to be left so that some genius can use it to teach themselves, no matter when they finally appear!\nSo, congratulations on becoming a graffiti genius, recognized by none other than yours truly!\nThough you, as things stand, might have never touched a spray can nor painted even a single work of graffiti... But perhaps, one day, you'll be a master of the art, admired by all!\nAlso, the stuff in this notebook isn't too complex. Plus, for a genius, all you need is a little hint to get the creative juices flowing.\nDisclaimer up front: All the key points in here aren't representative of all the graffiti artists in Natlan. All I discuss is my own avant-garde artistry.\nEven within the Graffiti Alliance, we've got masters of all kinds of styles, and each kind of art is incredibly extensive! If you want to study other styles too, no prob, take your time.\nAnd now, back to business.\nI've heard that nations like Liyue and Fontaine have their own mature artistic schools, with strict teaching methods. Painting for them is a proper discipline.\nBut we aren't that serious in Natlan when it comes to graffiti! Nobody's gonna criticize your brush strokes for being substandard or say your shape is off while you're spraying paint.\nNo matter who they are or where they come from, anybody can pick up a spray can, and as long as they don't cause trouble for anybody else, then they can start painting graffiti on any flat surface they can find.\n...\nNow, let's talk about the origin of graffiti — \"Phlogiston Engravings,\" totems of power, the symbols of battle and protection...\nGraffiti is a kind of painting that expresses your thoughts, a reflection of the simplest, purest emotions of the heart.\nSo, as you may have guessed, the first step is to find the shape and color of \"emotions.\"\nThat's why I always ask newbies to use their own eyes to bear witness to the natural conditions and local customs in Natlan, to understand the shapes and color palettes present.\nThat's the only way to make even deeper creations and turn our innermost thoughts into powerful graffiti.\nFor example, if you want to inspire warriors fighting against the Abyss, just calmly repeating the words \"You can do it!\" isn't anywhere near strong enough.\nWe often serve the warriors liquor, drink with them, sing with them, dance with them like no one is watching, and curse the living daylights out of Abyssal spawn with them! Letting it all out makes them feel better, and they'll be at ease as they battle!\nWhen painting graffiti with the theme of warriors resisting the Abyss, you need to make our homeland look incomparably bright and colorful — give the warriors a radiant glow as bright as the sun.\nLet's say the natural brightness of Natlan's colors is about a 15 in reality. Then you've gotta do your best to find paints that use ingredients like nobody's business and crank the brightness of the colors of our homeland and the warriors up to 50.\nAnd as for the enemies over on the side of the Abyss, they usually get dark blues, dark purples, various greys... Lots of different dark colors.\nLet's say the brightness of their actual colors is about a 10. In your graffiti, the brightness level should only be around 2 to 3.\nAnd if you want to paint shadows, you don't need to worry about the shades of gray. Just compress it all into nothing but black.\nThat way, the intense juxtaposition of the colors will imbue your graffiti with the basic qualities it needs to catch people's attention and express your inner feelings simply and clearly!\nYou should be aware that most people only spend 30 seconds or less looking at any given painting, much less roadside graffiti on the wall.\nWhile a painting that uses traditional techniques, and emphasizes authentic colors with complex lighting and realistic shadows is certainly quite elegant, it's a completely different thing from graffiti.\n...\nAlright, now that you understand everything, your new top priority is to paint graffiti of the \"Night Warden Wars,\" scaled to show hundreds of people. For practice.\nJust kidding.\nIntense colors aren't enough. You've got to be able to paint extremely exaggerated forms with lines bursting with tension, yet ensure everything stays recognizable.\nIf something seems straight enough, make it ruler-straight.\nIf it's got horns, make them sharp as knives. Terrifying!\nIf a figure is dynamic, like they're leaning back as they brace themselves, preparing to draw their weapon, then draw that person with a flexible curve, like a bow pulled fully taut...\nIn the process of fighting all kinds of foes, you should have gotten used to extreme back-and-forth combat, swinging your arms and brandishing your blade countless times.\nWhen you see an enemy make a crazy move, do you worry about their lumbar or neck? Have you ever thought their movements could be even more exaggerated?\nAnyway, in my style of graffiti, the more extreme the pose — or should I say, \"dynamic\" — the more it's worth trying out.\nAfter all, everyone's used to realism and aestheticism in paintings. Those two styles have been mature for ages, and are as common as dirt.\nOne of the elements of \"avant-garde\" and \"new wave\" is finding methods of expression that nobody's ever tried before!\nRemember! Exaggerate the contours to the extreme, and put in as much tension as you can!\n...\nThat's pretty much all that needs to be said about the two key points.\nAs for the details, like how aesthetically appealing the ratio of facial features is, or how accurate the shapes of objects are... Don't get bogged down in details when you're first starting out. There's plenty of time to just practice as you paint!\nStart out with \"avant-garde\" expression, develop your ability to create the overall composition, then find whatever works best for you, one painting at a time!\nThat's enough for now. As for the next key point, I'll save the details for the next phase.\nIf you run into any tough problems in the process of putting it into practice, feel free to drop by the Masters of the Night-Wind's Graffiti Alliance headquarters and find me!\n"},{"id":"Book927","title":"Book927","filename":"Book927_EN.txt","text":"Angakuk, Mighty Wayob, collective consciousness and guardian of the past, will without form or thought...\nMy whole life have I spent in pursuit... that silent... place deeper than the deepest valley...\nNow my life nears its end, Angakuk, otherwise known as the will of the Wayob...\nLet the birds carry me away, just as they would a branch...\nCarry me away, to the place where all souls become one, to be reunited with my friends."},{"id":"Book928","title":"Book928","filename":"Book928_EN.txt","text":"Angakuk, Angakuk.\nWhere will I hear that voice from beneath the earth...\nOr a rumbling from even deeper underground.

The first Pyro Archon had not yet been born, and so none yet had Visions, could do naught but be controlled by the elements.\n\nUntil Waxaklahun Ubah Kan brought back the kindling of phlogiston from the red and black land. Only then did humanity gain the power to vie with wild beasts and fell dragons.\n\nNow, astute listeners might already be wondering, as a human, how could the Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan steal the phlogiston kindling from the claws of the evil dragons?\n\nThat is precisely the first story I am going to tell.\n\nLegends tell us that long, long ago, in the red and black lands, there lived a winged dragon. That dragon was the scion of the great lord of the volcano, Xiuhcoatl.\n\nIn some versions of the story, it is said he was none other than Xiuhcoatl himself, but the gods only know what kind of storyteller would make such a mistake. After all, who could forget that the one who defeated Xiuhcoatl was the very first Pyro Archon, Xbalanque himself. How could things have been resolved at a point so early in the story?\n\nAnyway, when the great lord of the volcano fell into deep slumber, this vain winged dragon claimed the treasures that once belonged to the former, and proclaimed itself to be the lone king.\n\nAmong those treasures, one of the most striking was known as \"Pyrophosphorite.\" That was a crystal refined of the primal fire in the depths of the great volcano, and its color was that of an ever-shifting rainbow, shining with dazzling light.\n\nIlluminated by this radiance, the winged dragon itself became bewitchingly brilliant.\n\n\"Gaze upon me and see how beautiful I am! My light illuminates the world, and I am the sun of this land.\"\n\nSo spake the winged dragon. But he was no sun, and his beauty was nothing but the reflection of the Pyrophosphorite's light. And in turn, that light did no more than illuminate the red and black lands in which it dwelt.\n\nPerhaps it was the vanity of the winged dragon that offended the Lord of the Night, for he sent the Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan to defeat him. But perhaps that seemed not enough to some, and so the gods sent the fool, Chaac, with him.\n\nUnder the protection of the Lord of the Night, the two arrived in the red and black lands, and far away, they saw that radiant winged dragon. Waxaklahun Ubah Kan was in no hurry to rush onward, but rather made a blowdart from bamboo, and struck the winged dragon's eye with a single shot.\n\nChaac watched with glee, and was about to charge up to capture the winged dragon, but was restrained by the Sage.\n\n\"Foolish Chaac, though one eye is now blinded, he still possesses limitless power. With your human body, just how do you intend to contend with him?\"\n\nThe wise Waxaklahun Ubah Kan thought up a better plan.\n\nThe wounded winged dragon returned to its cave to hide, and so the Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan and the fool Chaac disguised themselves as doctors and entered the cave.\n\n\"My word! How glorious you are! How splendid and radiant! Ah, but what a shame that you cannot see yourself, and neither can the masses behold your beauty.\"\n\nWaxaklahun Ubah Kan praised him.\n\n\"It's all because a few days ago, some despicable maggot shot and blinded my eye. That is why I can but hide in this cave.\"\n\n\"Now that is truly serendipitous! We happen to be traveling doctors specializing in curing eye diseases. In my opinion, if you replace your eye with a bright gem, you will once more be able to see the light,\" said the Sage. \"And not only that, but we can even replace your fangs and claws with gems, that you would surely shine a dozen times more brightly than you already do.\"\n\nHearing these words, the conceited winged dragon could not help but fantasize about how beautiful it would be when it was twelve times more radiant. It happily agreed without stopping to think about it in any detail.\n\nAnd so the Sage and the fool Chaac took out the grainfruit they had earlier prepared, and one by one replaced the winged dragon's eyes, fangs, and claws with grainfruit.\n\nAh, the poor winged dragon! Not only was his eye not healed, but by the time he realized he had been tricked, he couldn't even eat those two little humans! And so he died in a daze, and the Pyrophosphorite fell into the hands of Waxaklahun Ubah Kan.\n\nThe fool, Chaac, thought they should offer the treasure to the Lord of the Night, but the wise Waxaklahun Ubah Kan had a different idea.\n\nHe knew that the dragons that ruled the land possessed power far beyond that of humanity, but did not necessarily have more wisdom. And the secret to power lay within that Pyrophosphorite.\n\nAnd so he broke it open, and vast power poured forth. The Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan thus gained the power of dragons — that which is known as \"Phlogiston.\""},{"id":"Book942","title":"Book942","filename":"Book942_EN.txt","text":"Next, I will tell you the story of how the Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan passed Phlogiston to the people of the tribes and built Hanan Pacha.\n\nAfter leaving the red and black lands, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan and the fool Chaac came to the land of forests and mountains, where human tribes lived.\n\nWaxaklahun Ubah Kan wished to pass on the power to use phlogiston to humans, but none wished to learn from him, for none knew just what use the phlogiston he spoke of was.\n\n\"If we want to make fire, we need only strike the flint. As for the fuel, there's firewood and vegetation everywhere. What use have we for phlogiston?\"\n\n\"O shortsighted people, do you not know there will come a day when all plants and firewood are consumed and are no more? And that the most plentiful, inexhaustible thing in the world is rocks? If you can use phlogiston to burn rocks, then you will have solved the problem of obtaining energy once and for all.\"\n\nThus spake the Sage, filled with confidence.\n\n\"Haha, I'm afraid we will never see that day come.\"\n\nThe people then could not yet see their ancestors in the Night Kingdom, and thus they naturally did not think of the future. And so Waxaklahun Ubah Kan had no choice but to give up.\n\nThe fool Chaac, seeing the Sage troubled by this, suggested a solution that would make the benefits phlogiston could bring readily apparent to all.\n\n\"So, like, we could take this big ol' rock and raise it up higher than the mountains, where everyone can see it. Then, like, everyone will totally get all curious and come running to us.\"\n\nThough they were the words of a fool, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan had little choice but to try. And so he first taught Chaac how to use phlogiston, and the two of them raised the land together. The land thus raised was none other than Hanan Pacha, the Upper Sanctum of which people today now speak.\n\nBut unlike today, the Hanan Pacha of those days was still a vast tract of land, whole and complete. It floated above the clouds, and all the humans of Natlan could confirm its existence with a glance. And so, one by one, people from all corners were driven there by their curiosity.\n\nThe kind-hearted Chaac stood guard by the lake, using the power of phlogiston to help the people ascend to Hanan Pacha. And those that ascended to Hanan Pacha learned the art of using phlogiston from the Sage Waxaklahun Ubah Kan.\n\nAnd under the leadership of Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, the people founded the first permanently settled tribe upon Hanan Pacha."},{"id":"Book943","title":"Book943","filename":"Book943_EN.txt","text":"Next, I will tell the story of how the people of Hanan Pacha broke the taboos and caused the Sage of the Stolen Flame to leave Natlan.\n\nAfter the people were taught how to use the power of phlogiston, they built a city on top of Hanan Pacha. Within the city were magnificent palaces and temples, all made of rare gems, brilliant feathers, and fragrant flowers.\n\nAfter completing all of this, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan decided to raise Hanan Pacha still higher.\n\n\"For this, all of you must no longer eat anything produced by this land, save for water, for all the streams of this world flow from the Source of All Waters, and are not subject to the Lord of the Night's control.\"\n\nChaac had no idea why they should go yet higher, and didn't want to leave Natlan. But whenever he went to ask Waxaklahun Ubah Kan this question, the latter would only speak of the \"Lunar continent\" and \"Newark Holy Stone\" and other stuff he couldn't understand.\n\nAs Waxaklahun Ubah Kan was the smartest person in the world, everyone did as he said. And so they began to raise fish in the blue expanse and grow ball algae for food, and Hanan Pacha flew higher each day.\n\nFinally, the Lord of the Night realized the Sage's intentions. As they feared humanity's departure, they decided to try and stop his plans.\n\nOne day, while the Sage was away, the Lord of the Night disguised himself as a human of the tribe, and, carrying a bottle of mysterious water, he found Chaac, waiting by the lake.\n\n\"Friend, don't guard the water of this lake any longer. See? The water I hold is a hundred times sweeter than that of the lake. Come, have a taste.\"\n\nThough he thought of what the Sage had said, it was just water, so it should be fine. Or so Chaac thought, reaching out and taking a sip.\n\nTrying it, he discovered the taste was truly sweet beyond compare. And so the Lord of the Night gave him more sweet water, and he brought it up to Hanan Pacha, sharing it with all.\n\nBut what Chaac did not know was that this sweet water was actually brewed from the grains grown from the land. In our modern parlance, it was alcohol.\n\nWhen the Sage returned, everyone was dead drunk.\n\nThe Sage knew that they could no longer leave Natlan, and so he expelled them from Hanan Pacha. The scattered people brought phlogiston with them to every corner of Natlan.\n\nAnd so the Sage of the Stolen Flame set out on the road home.\n\n\"The road home? Does that mean he went back to the red and black lands?\"\n\n\"Were you listening or not? The red and black lands were where the Sage stole phlogiston. Hrm, though the legends don't actually say just where the Sage's homeland was... So I suppose what 'the road home' means is that someday, he will return.\"\n\n\"C'mon, that's obviously just one of those storyteller's lines you guys always use. How about you cut it with the suspense?\"\n\nAnyway, after the Sage of the Stolen Flame left, Chaac accepted the guidance of the Lord of the Night, and established permanently settled tribes on the land. The age of the humans of Natlan began, but that is a story for another time."},{"id":"Book944","title":"Book944","filename":"Book944_EN.txt","text":"Long, long ago, that dim star was as bright as all the other stars you now see, yet the lives of the tribespeople were much the same as they are in the present day. To you, this way of life may seem overly familiar, perhaps nothing special, even lacking in excitement; but for Qoyllor, who lived on that star, it was anything but ordinary... Though the star that Qoyllor lived on was the one that was closest to the tribes, yet still she was inestimably far away from her brothers and sisters. Like you, she was always full of curiosity for things she didn't understand. Just as we who live on the ground gaze up in awe at the starry sky, she too would often look down with great interest upon the tribes on the ground.\nBut one day, Qoyllor leaned too far forward and accidentally fell from the sky. Falling to the ground, the star lost its former brilliance, and her power shattered into fragments that were scattered across the land. Her father, the Sun, had entrusted her with this power, exhorting her to guard it carefully — but now, without that power, she could never again return to the sky! Qoyllor reflected upon how, when she was simply observing it from the star, life on the ground had seemed so fascinating to her; yet now that she had to give up her original life and became a part of it, it all seemed far less satisfying...\nFor a long time, Qoyllor wandered alone, facing many dangers, for the wilderness back then was far more perilous than it is now. Yet despite her tribulations, she found nothing. Later, by utter chance, she met Ukuku, a hunter from the tribe, and things began to change. Ukuku was a fierce warrior, as strong and silent as a bear. Upon learning of Qoyllor's plight, he agreed to help her search for the scattered shards of her star, then send her back home. He prided himself on his skills as a hunter — both his prowess in the chase, and of course, his mastery of the art of tracking too.\nSo side by side, they set off on their roamings. They climbed high mountains and scaled great peaks, ventured into deep ravines and gloomy caverns; and in the process, defeated hordes of enemies and made scores of friends. Under Ukuku's watchful guidance, Qoyllor grew accustomed to life on the ground. Just like you and me — perhaps even better than some of us — she hunted, fought, and rested with Saurians, recounted the incredible stories she had heard from the mouths of the storytellers to the children of the tribe, ate Tatacos, and chased after the Monetoo... Yet occasionally, on those nights back then unlit by glowing graffiti, the stars in the night sky would suddenly remind her of her distant home. Now, she was even further from her brothers and sisters... Did they miss her too?\n...\nAfter years of fruitless searching, Qoyllor began to wonder — perhaps, in the same way that she had become a part of the tribe, her lost power had long since been found. Perhaps the birds, beasts, insects, and snakes had claimed it for their own? When she asked Ukuku if he had grown tired of chasing such an elusive goal, the only answer he gave was a short \"Sorry.\" \"What a tongue-tied hunter!\" she thought to herself. \"Yet his heart is kind.\" Besides, they had been searching blindly from the very start, and it was by any reckoning a difficult task — and besides, it really had nothing to do with Ukuku from the first, so his apology was utterly misplaced. Thinking back on how this quiet hunter had taken such good care of her, Qoyllor could only marvel at his kindness...\nLater on, Qoyllor and Ukuku were to form a family together, settling down in a corner of the tribe. And to think, the young children of the tribe had not the slightest inkling that one of their neighbors had fallen from the stars! Qoyllor had always been of a cheerful disposition, and when things happened that could not be helped, she simply let them be. Though her homeland was now far out of reach, the twinkling stars seemed to greet her as if they were her brothers and sisters themselves, and so she was content. But Ukuku, whose wish had seemingly come true, became even more silent and gloomy than before. Some said it was just his nature, while others speculated that he was haunted by guilt as a result of having failed to fulfill his promise to Qoyllor... Such theories each have their merits, but as you know, when someone harbors an unspeakable secret, they tend to appear melancholy, and this was certainly the case with Ukuku.\nBut what exactly was this secret that Ukuku was hiding? Forgive me, I must keep you in suspense for now, and instead return to the matter of neighbors. It is said that a relative far off is less helpful than a neighbor close by, and in the tribe, we always rely on the support of our neighbors and friends. As bad luck would have it, their neighbor Pochica was a troublemaker who had never gotten along with Ukuku. He had always tried to make things difficult for Ukuku, but as long as Ukuku ignored him, things never escalated — so before Qoyllor's arrival, they managed to coexist. But Qoyllor's presence ignited a spark of jealousy in Pochica, and once that spark was lit, it could not be so easily extinguished. \"Ukuku is a kind person, and kind people always put the needs of others above their own.\" Of course, Pochica was well aware of what the other tribespeople thought of Ukuku, but he clearly saw things differently. \"What a bore he is, a complete and utter bore! But I can use his 'kindness' against him, and in the end, it will save me much trouble.\"\nPochica's plan was very simple: he would, from time to time, speak badly of Ukuku in front of Qoyllor, adding a bit of \"color\" here and there, embellishing his stories with malicious barbs. You might wonder how such a clumsy trick could work, but do not forget — the extreme reticence, even gloominess, that Ukuku had shown of late could be hard to bear for someone whose origins were as special as Qoyllor's... \"Ah, look at you, like a bird that has had its wings clipped.\" When he was talking to Qoyllor, Pochica always took on an air of intimacy. \"He's always been like this. Whenever he found a bird he liked, he'd clip its wings to stop it from flying away, then lock it in a cage. Pitiful, truly pitiful!\"\nAt first, Qoyllor paid no attention to her vindictive neighbor's gossip, but after years of hearing it time and time again, she could not help but begin to have doubts. She longed to know what was in Ukuku's heart, but neither did she want to make a big deal out of nothing, so she tried probing with a few comments disguised as playful remarks. Yet always Ukuku seemed unwilling to engage, either dodging her questions or simply adopting his usual gloomy demeanor and answering only with heavy silence.\nNow, let us return to the secret that Ukuku had kept hidden within his heart. Everything he did only served to deepen Qoyllor's suspicions, and she was the type that liked to get to the bottom of things — after all, if it wasn't for that, she would never have fallen from her star in the first place. Under the pressure of her questioning, Ukuku soon confessed his secret. It turned out that in the course of their past travels together, he had indeed found some star shards. In other words, the goal that had always seemed so elusive to Qoyllor was not entirely without its clues. But by that time, Ukuku had already developed feelings for her, and he knew that when the day came when all the shards had been found, Qoyllor would return to the stars, and they would never see one another again...\nAs I see it, it is hard for anyone to persist in something that goes against their nature for long, and Ukuku was no exception to this rule. When he finally revealed his innermost secret, it was as if a heavy weight had been lifted from his shoulders, and even the gloom on his face seemed to lessen. Yet having heard his confession, Qoyllor felt only sadness and anger — deceit and betrayal were things she had never before known, but now she understood their bitter pang.\nShe really was a bird whose wings had been clipped! Thinking such a thought only served to convince Qoyllor that Ukuku's actions could not be forgiven. And as we all know, though it takes great time to build, deep trust can be destroyed in an instant. Qoyllor demanded that Ukuku hand over the star shards he had hidden, but Ukuku refused. He could not bear the thought of parting with her, still believing that as long as he kept her close, there was always a chance that he might turn things around. But this was a vain idea — for as we all have our limits when it comes to forgiveness, and these vary from person to person, so for Qoyllor did the buck stop at deceit and betrayal.\nIgnoring his pleas, Qoyllor left the tribe she had once considered home, returning to the same wilderness she had wandered when she first fell down to the ground. But this time it was different — she knew what she had to do. Like a true person of Natlan, she left a huge work of graffiti on the vast expanse of land. How big was it? Though it can now be seen no longer, it is said that those who witnessed it at the time remarked that it might well have been bigger than a volcano! You could not have missed such a gigantic piece of graffiti, even if you were gazing down from the Sun itself. And indeed, that was her intention. Let her lost power be, she thought to herself. Whether hidden by Ukuku, or claimed by the birds, beasts, insects, and snakes, it mattered not — for she could always turn to her father, the one who had bestowed this power upon her in the first place, and was willing to accept any punishment that might come her way.\nAnd lo! Qoyllor's Sun-father saw her plea, quickly bringing her back to the sky. That star that had lost its power became dim, and was now almost invisible unless you looked very closely. Would Qoyllor still look down at the land, observing the lives of the people below as she once did? I do not know the answer to that, but what is certain is that she was reunited with her many brothers and sisters, returned to a place that even the mightiest Iktomisaurus could not reach.\nAs for Ukuku, who had been left behind, his deceit and betrayal angered the Sun. As punishment, he was blinded by the Sun's golden arrows. From then on, wherever he went, the Sun would retreat behind the clouds, leaving him without a trace of sunlight. Even their child Kuntur, who was still very young at the time, was affected by this. As a result, he was unable to form a single friendship with any Saurian until he had grown up to be a young man. But as for Kuntur's adventures thereafter... Well, that is another story entirely."},{"id":"Book945","title":"Book945","filename":"Book945_EN.txt","text":"This is one part of the story of the Volcano Lord's struggle against the people of the tribes.\nIf we were to start from the beginning, the storyteller might have to spend seventeen days and seventeen nights by the bonfire to finish, and by the end, the children might have fallen into dreamland on account of the lengthy tale — no one would hear the best part of the ending.\nAs such, let us skip some of the... Let's just call them \"the parts less important to the listeners.\"\nInstead, let us speak of the Volcano Lord and the Shadow Pin that hangs above the Sulfurous Veins:\n\nOur story unfolds in a time when great beasts withdrew from this land, and when the empty Great Volcano of Tollan was occupied by the dark Volcano Lord.\nThe Great Volcano was once the dwelling of great dragons, and on this matter little further need be said. But when they fled amidst the flames, their dwelling was seized by the devious Volcano Lord.\nNo one now knows what said Lord looked like, but the tribal elders who saw it all say it was a black-and-purple giant with a salamander's form. In ancient times, some conflated salamanders with dragons, but nowadays everyone knows that a salamander is just that.\nAnyway, the Volcano Lord dominated the lands of Natlan, committing countless vile acts. It bathed in the springs of the middle sea, causing the People of the Springs to be filled with smog, and it blew a wind filled with sparks to the Scions of the Canopy. At its worst, it even swallowed the entire Collective of Plenty! That would have been trouble indeed, had the Tatankasaurs and the tribe's warriors not breached its stomach while it slept and escaped.\nAll in all, this being did every wicked thing you could imagine, causing untold suffering to the tribes.\nAnd on this particular day, it lay within the volcano, gazing at its dark form... and a new, wicked thought came to it.\n\"Bah, it's just so dark down here under the volcano, even darker than a moonless night! I can't even see my own body.\"\n\"I've heard that the valleys of the Children of Echoes to the east are home to countless gems. If I could swallow all those shiny stones, then my stomach shall shine brightly like the starry night sky even in the darkest of places.\"\nSo saying, it turned about, having decided to do just that.\nBut the Volcano Lord was far too large, and it missed his notice that a little Flying Squirrel had heard his words.\nThe little Flying Squirrel hurried to tell the story to a flying Phlogiston Aphid. The Aphid flew on high and told all it knew to a grazing Long-Necked Rhino, who then told a Tepetlisaurus with whom it was best friends. This Tepetlisaurus, in turn, was none other than the Saurian companion of the Children of Echoes elder, Traore.\nAnd thus did Elder Traore hear of the Volcano Lord's plot to seize the gems from his companion.\nThis was terrible timing for the Children. Their strongest warrior, their Chief Sundjatta, and his companions had followed the hero Tenoch to the island in the far west to halt the giant dark beast, and could not do battle against the Volcano Lord.\nAnd so Traore and the warriors guarding the tribe sought aid from their tribe's Wayob, for all within the tribe knew that the Wayob symbolized all wisdom and the greatest of souls.\nUnder the Wayob's guidance, Traore came up with a way to resist the Volcano Lord, so he and the soldiers made ready, sure to inflict a crushing defeat on him.\n\nThe Volcano Lord caused the volcano to belch thick smoke, hiding himself within the smog. It was with such fanfare that he drew near to the valley of the Children of Echoes.\nWhen he reached the Sulfurous Veins, he saw a tiny tribesperson standing there, as if long having awaited his arrival. This was Traore.\nTraore said, \"O Lord, O Volcano Lord, long have we heard of your departure. Long have we believed that your majestic form should by right be adorned with our finest gemstones. For this, we have specially built a stone chamber, and placed all our gems within.\"\nNow, the Volcano Lord thought, how did these puny people know that he had come to take their gems?\nNonetheless, he was a mighty overlord! What need had he to concern himself with such matters? Thus did he gladly follow Traore to the stone chamber, only to pause in confusion once he laid eyes upon the chamber.\nFor the gate to the chamber was only human-sized, far too small for giant black salamander!\n\"Is this the chamber?\" The Volcano Lord expelled hot air in displeasure. \"How am I to enter it?\"\n\"Alas, Lord, but our hasty preparation is to blame. For we are but puny humans, unable to construct great palaces to contain your magnificent form. But you may still reach your hand into it — the treasures are there for the taking,\" Traore said.\n\"But I cannot see what is within, you sly little human. Looking to play tricks on your overlord, are you? Hah! Think you that I do not see how must have hidden a mechanism within that shall do hurt to my arm?\"\n\"Please do not worry, Lord,\" Traore said. \"See! I shall enter the stone chamber first, and then you can stretch your hand in after me. Should there be a trap to hurt you, will it not slay me first? Our tribe fears death and loves life almost as much as we love our gems — we'd never make such a sacrifice.\"\nTrue, that, the Volcano Lord thought. These puny little tribespeople always prized their lives, did they not? Why else would they have prepared a tribute of gems even before he had even arrived?\nAnd thus did Traore enter the stone chamber, golden whistle in hand, and the Volcano Lord extended his arm after him.\nAnd lo, there were indeed piles of gems inside. Traore poured jewels and ores into the Volcano Lord's hand, and the fist the Lord balled around the stones grew larger and larger... until it was larger even than the chamber gate!\nAnd it was at that moment—!\nTraore blew his golden whistle.\nThe tribal warriors, lying in ambush by the stone chamber, prayed that their Wayob would unveil its power there and then. And the Wayob, borrowing four sewing pins — three short and one long — from the tribespeople, blew them toward the Volcano Lord.\nThe four pins absorbed the power of both the tribespeople's flesh and blood and the Wayob, and so they grew as they flew, turning into four titanic phlogiston nails.\nOnly then did the overlord realize that he had fallen into a trap, and cursed in his heart the cunning tribespeople. But his hand, so filled with gems, could no longer be opened. There was no retracting it from the stone chamber.\nOne pin! Two pins! Three pins!\nThe three smaller stone pillars pinned its jet-black arm to the Sulfurous Veins.\nBut before the last and largest stone pillar could fall, the Volcano Lord, gritting its teeth, severed its own arm and fled.\nThat black arm was left pinned to the ground like a shadow, which is why the long crystalline pillars of the Sulfurous Veins are known as Shadow Pins.\nAs for the longest, largest Shadow Pin, it did not completely fall to the earth, for the Volcano Lord had already fled before then. However, so long as that Shadow Pin remains suspended over the Sulfurous Veins, never again shall the Volcano Lord dare draw near the Children of Echoes.\nAnd this is the story of said Lord and the Shadow Pins.\n\nAs for Traore, who boldly used himself as bait, how did he escape the chamber, blocked as it now was by the Volcano Lord's arm?\nWhy, he must have mastered some marvelous skill, of course. After all, there are many more legends concerning him that take place after this one..."},{"id":"Book946","title":"Book946","filename":"Book946_EN.txt","text":"<image name=UI_ReadPic_1501301/>\nThis tale comes from the desolate, distant past. In those days, the mountains' teeth were still bared like blades against man and beast, thirsting for the souls of the feeble-minded, human and nonhuman alike.\nPeople knew that the god of the mountains loved them not, and was to be given a wide berth. Yet they were forced to seek shelter in caverns from the storms screaming through the wilds, all to pass one long night after the next. But these caverns, like the mountains, extracted payment from these vagrants. Countless were the tribes who lost kin to the wastes through which they stumbled blind.\n\nValiant Tequil and his kindhearted brother Rimac were born to one such tribe.\n\nAt the hour of their birth, a long, troubling night reigned inside and outside the caves, and though the campfires around which the tribespeople sat flickered, none were comforted by their light.\nThe people thought:\n\"This fire shall soon go out, and once it does, we too shall be finished!\"\n\"How long will this night last? I'm cold... and hungry too...\"\n\"Let's hurry things up then! Quickly, let me walk into the night! Better that than this torment.\"\n\"Oh, you poor children... You poor, poor children...\"\n\nYet Tequil and Rimac did not announce themselves with sorrowful cries as other children did.\nInstead, Tequil stared into the cavern depths. The minions of the cavern did their best to frighten him, but his gaze swept over them, keen as a sharp stone spur.\n\"He has seen us, our sharp claws and long teeth, but he is not afraid!\"\nThe wicked creatures whispered amongst themselves anxiously, and involuntarily retracted said appendages.\n\n\nRimac for his part waved his hands and laughed, and his laughter was like pebbles tumbling in a stream, drawing the eyes of all the distressed tribespeople to his face. Only then did they notice that though the flame wavered, it had never ceased to burn, and with another wave of his hands, Rimac patted the firewood next to him.\n\n\"Feed the flame! Feed the flame!\"\nThe elderly chief, thus reminded by the newborn boy, shouted his words aloud, repelling the fear that had been about to swallow the tribe whole.\n\nPeople stood and fueled the fire, and they drew their obsidian blades, casting their eyes into the cavern depths just as Tequil had.\n\nThe beasts of the cavern were filled with rage and hate, but they knew that these people would not loosen their grip on their weapons, nor would their eyes be shut. Terror had already fled, and so death was forced to retreat.\n\nOnly when the sun rose again did the brothers close their eyes, falling asleep in their mother's bosom.\n\nThus did the tribespeople depart the cave, having lived another day. These people, who had rejected fear, would live countless days more.\n\nYet the defeat of her evil underlings caught the eye of their master, Coatlicue.\nFor this lord of demons, who claimed to be the mother of the underworld and mistress of ten thousand times ten thousand caves, whose fangs were the rocky stalactites, whose tongue was every blast of wet, frigid wind, and who upon awakening could only be satiated by devouring ten thousand living souls — Tequil and Rimac were the first humans to slip her grasp.\nShamefaced, this earth mother waved her hand, lashing the evil beasts cowering to the side with rock.\n\"Go! Go! Redeem your humiliating failure! Capture those dimwitted mortals and fill my stomach!\"\n\nBut having seen their fears vanquished, the people remembered well the methods of scattering those terrors time after time.\n\nThey settled at the foot of the mountains, sharpened wooden stakes, lit fires, and gave the sharpest blades to their best warriors, with which they would stand guard behind the stakes. Their bright eyes pierced the wilderness beyond the firelight, and did not shift their gazes away for even a moment.\n\nBy blade and fire did Coatlicue's minions taste defeat time after time, until they could do nothing but huddle in the dark, daring not to draw near the flame.\n\nThe fires in the hearts of the people ignited, and they began to speak of victory, of light, and of the end of the viper — they believed in Tequil and Rimac. These two brothers could surely keep the heat and light alive.\n\nTequil and Rimac thought the same, and so they sharpened their spears and blades, preparing to drive the demon lord of that evil serpent to her doom.\n\nBut the earth mother, who hated this tribe, did not relent.\nShe took sludge from the deepest parts of the cave and pinched it into a snake. Then, she plucked out her eye, setting it into the serpent's eye socket.\n\"It was that child who caused you to witness the fire, and so, let me go and swallow his eyes.\"\n\nOne evening, when the sun had just set, night's veil was slowly covering the sky, and the stars had yet to begin granting their light, the serpent bit and slew a rabbit beyond the tribe's bounds, and burrowed into its skin, lying flat on the ground.\n\nRimac, returning from gathering herbs, came upon this rabbit, and seeing its wound, the kind child put his torch down without hesitation, and reaching for his herbs, he chewed on them, preparing to apply them to the rabbit. But the snake, speaking for the earth mother, leaped from the wound, hissing laughter:\n\n\"Hahaha, ignorant, foolish human! Sacrificing yourself for a lowly rabbit!\"\n\nBefore Rimac could retrieve his torch, the earth mother's serpent latched its fangs first onto his neck, then, burrowing into his body, captured his heart and soul both.\n\nThe defenseless sentries were the next to be murdered by the earth mother, for they greeted Rimac just as they always did when he returned from gathering herbs, only to be pierced through the heart by the serpent, dying on the spot. The entire tribe's fires were put out, and amidst the shroud of darkness, death and terror were resurgent.\n\nThe earth mother spat the snake out, and through poisoned fangs she cried out:\n\"Behold! Behold, you arrogant fools, and kneel as you should in the dust!\"\n\nBut the sound of a rock being struck cut her off, for Tequil, who had been sharpening his obsidian blade, used it to create sparks that set his tent alight.\n\nHe raised his blade and charged forward, letting fly his blade at the earth mother's messenger. The blazing edge cleaved the poisoned serpent molded from soil with ease, but as Tequil was about to follow through, he saw his brother's eyes and the blood staining his brother's hands.\n\nThat instant was all the time the wounded viper needed to escape. Yet nigh fully charred it was still, and the earth mother's eye reduced almost to ashes.\n\nThis tribe was destroyed, and never again was there a chance it would dare defy her.\n\nThus did the earth mother comfort herself as she retreated into the darkness.\nHow Tequil wished to call out Rimac's name! But the burning dust caught in his throat, and so he could only watch as his brother vanished into the night.\n\nWhen the night at last passed, Tequil, who stood amidst the ruins, knew that the surviving tribespeople could no longer stay. Burying his confusion and pain deep in his heart, he led them on a new journey.\n\nThey crossed mountains and canyons, dodging fearsome beasts and poisonous insects. Tequil did not close his eyes for so long as they journeyed, nor did he dare to loosen his grip on blade or torch.\n\nFinally, by a silent volcano, they found a tribe willing to take them in.\n\nOnly after he saw the last of his tribe peacefully fall into slumber under the old shaman's care did he relax and collapse to the earth.\n\nWhen he awoke, he found himself in a blazing cave. The lava that surrounded him undulated with an erratic pulse, as if the very mountain was slowly breathing. When he stood up, the lava boiled and bubbled, and a rumbling came from all directions:\n\n\"Do not search for your brother. His eyes have been devoured by a cunning serpent.\"\n\"But I must save him, and pursue that venomous snake also!\"\n\nHis words echoed through the cave, but the Goddess of Mountains and Fire was silent.\nTequil thus prayed unto her:\n\"Let my brother's name live on. I am willing to sacrifice my heart and blood in return.\"\nThe goddess answered him in the echoing cave.\nThus said she:\n\"Your prayer have I heard, but your brother is no longer your kin. His name has sunken into the deepest of depths.\"\nTequil raised his head and lifted up his wish to the goddess:\n\"Turn my blood to fire, so my heart may illuminate the depths. I will bring my brother back before my blood runs dry.\"\n\"Turn my blood to fire, until my soul may sear and slay that serpent. I will take its head before my blood runs dry.\"\n\nWhen Tequil awoke once again, the old shaman of the tribe gave him a brand-new sword, food, and water.\nFinally, the shaman clasped his shoulders and blessed him:\n\"May your fire dry the venomous snake's venom.\"\n\nThus did Tequil embark on another journey. His strength was endless, his body tireless, and his blood burned like lava. He crossed grassy fields and snowy peaks, deep valleys and high mountains, and the Goddess of Mountains and Fire showed him the way with falling rocks and the cracks in cliffs. Thus did Tequil stride forward without hesitation.\n\nWhen he met his brother again, the earth mother mocked him once more using Rimac's body and voice, but when her claws pierced Tequil's chest, he moved not, and instead her bones were melted by his burning blood.\nTequil stared the vicious demon lord down, and said in a loud voice:\n\"My brother is gentle of heart. He would surely have made this land a better place.\"\n\"Yet you have affronted him with your poison, smothered his virtue, slaughtered those who had faith in his virtue!\"\n\"Die, you despicable, venomous insect! Die here!\"\nAs he roared, Tequil's blood stained his obsidian blade, turning it red-hot in an instant. The earth mother watched in terror as her shell, bones, and soul were sundered. She wished to scream, to buy but a moment in which she could unleash her claws and tear Tequil to ribbons.\nBut she could make no sound, for in the fire's light, the silent soul to whom this body once belonged awakened. And that soul cried out to his brother:\n\"I do not wish to see your blood be reduced to ash, but I have seen the light of your heart and spirit. Remember my name, brother. As long as you remember me, I will never have left.\"\n\nThe blazing flames swept over every corner in that gloomy, frigid cavern, and every last poisonous insect within was slain, burned to ash alongside every plot and scheme, so heinous and vile.\nAs the last drop of his blood was about to burn away, the roof of the cave above Tequil's head trembled. A fissure opened, and a gem fell down and stopped up his wound.\nThe Goddess of Mountains and Fire spoke once more, and her voice echoed across the walls:\n\"You yet have one drop of blood. Return to your tribe, for this is your brother's wish, and I will see it fulfilled.\"\n\nOne night, the old shaman who had waited day after day beyond the tribe's bounds stood to welcome the returning Tequil.\nBut Tequil refused the water, the food, and the cheers. Instead, he simply said:\n\"The venomous snake is slain, and I am victorious. But I shall soon depart along with my brother.\"\n\nHe took the gem from his chest, placed it upon a torch, and walked up to the silent volcano.\n\"I have but one drop of blood left, but it was not left for me, but rather, for justice and fairness, for the good and the brave.\"\n\"Use it, and light a fire — a flame that shall never be extinguished.\"\n\nHaving said that, valiant Tequil leaped into the dead volcano. The earth was shaken by his heart and blood, and the volcano's own heart resumed beating, the blazing lava once more beginning to flow.\nThe volcano lives — as does the bravery of all the tribes."},{"id":"Book947","title":"Book947","filename":"Book947_EN.txt","text":"This tale comes from the desolate, distant past.

Weather's good, but I can't say that about my mood.\nI knew I was here to watch over these troublesome pests, yet I had not expected there to be quite so many of them.\nI have heard messengers from Cinder City tell of how those who encountered these pests would fall into the throes of an illness that would grip them day and night, of how the boils that broke forth all over their bodies would be followed by incessant vomiting, before they finally suffered a drastic change in personality and eventually became so frail that they perished.\nAnd we have all heard of the terrible transformation that befell Lord Milchi after coming into contact with them, ranting day and night about tearing any who would dare set foot upon the Isle of Night limb from limb. If even a hero of such stature met with such a fate, then surely any ordinary person wouldn't stand a chance?\nAnd there were also those warriors that Dad could not save... the wounds that were left on their bodies, as if they had been torn to shreds by something sharp. These pests bristle with spikes and fangs, so this must have been their doing too...\nThey should have been eradicated long ago! I cannot for the life of me understand why we're wasting time watching over them, even feeding them... In the words of Lord Och-Kan, the only thing they deserve to eat is a good old knuckle sandwich!\nAlas, if I had known, I would have just followed in Dad's footsteps and studied medicine, or else trained properly with Mom. Now, here I am... No longer with any hope of becoming either a warrior or a doctor, just a lousy guard for these wretched pests. Sure sucks to be me...\n...\nDay 475, and the weather is clear.\nThankfully, finally, Lord Milchi came back today. Another two days and we'd have run out of food for real.\nNo more Grainfruit, Cacahuatl, or meat of any kind... And no more Mora, either.\nHmph! Saurus Crackers and Grainfruit for breakfast, meat for lunch, and fish for dinner — no wonder all the Mora's gone! All the money I'd saved up to buy a ladder spent on stuffing their bellies!\nNow even the skinniest Saurians are at least a couple of belly sizes up from what mine would be if I were one of them, yet still they make me climb up and down all day... \"a bit of exercise,\" they call it. If you ask me, these Saurians should have to maintain the switches themselves! Let them get some exercise and lose some weight so they don't end up getting sick, and I don't end up having to make more medicine for them.\nBut still, it's true that we can't cut back on bird eggs for the hatchlings. They only just hatched, and they're still growing, so they need the extra nutrition.\nAlso, it seems a few more invaders arrived today, trying to set fire to the entire Isle of Night. Thankfully, the Secret Source Sentinels spotted them and chased them off before it was too late. Otherwise, things could've gotten really bad...\nThose fools from Cinder City, we chase away one batch of them, and another shows up. All they ever talk about is \"curses\" and \"pests.\" They can't be reasoned with, and they're bent on wrecking things too. Such a pain in the...\n—Ha! Illnesses? Festering wounds? Where did they get such nonsense from? These Saurians might be a bit on the energetic side, and they sure have big appetites, but they're clean as clean can be. I should know, because I'm the one who washes them! They're spotless — cleaner than any of you lot, that's for sure!\nAnd curses? If it wasn't for Lord Milchi's kind heart, I would've had the Secret Source Sentinels clobber you fools long ago! And the idea of Atlatl being cursed... What a joke.\nIf Lord Milchi would just listen to me and assent to the use of stronger weapons, we'd have long since washed our hands of all this. It's driving me up the wall... Anyway, that's enough for today. I still have to repair the switches and get on with my training tomorrow, so there'll be plenty for me to get on with...\n...\nI've lost count of how many days it's been, and I have no idea what the weather is like outside. If I had to guess, I'd say this is about the fifth day I've been in hiding. This will probably end up being the last diary entry I make.\nIf I'd have known things would come to this, I should have tried harder to stop Lord Milchi. Thinking back on it all, there were so many warning signs...\nMore and more frequent attacks, restless packs of Saurians, unhatched Saurian eggs, orders to execute the little ones, and rumors of rebellions among the various tribes...\nIn such a dire situation, a summons could only ever mean bad news.\nAside from blades, I honestly cannot imagine what else might await Lord Milchi...\nAnd the end result was never in doubt either. The Isle of Night was utterly defenseless without Lord Milchi, and would have fallen to any old band of warriors.\nFortunately, Lord Milchi was ready, and as soon as the orders came through, was able to take advantage of the chaos to set the little ones free.\nBut Saurian eggs don't have legs, nor can they be so easily transported, so I had to hide it. If only Lord Atlatl were still here... With his help, I'm sure we could have moved it too.\nI honestly cannot fathom why Lord Milchi chose not to escape with us, and instead insisted on confronting Och-Kan...\nOh right! Also, while hiding the egg, I gave it the name that I had long since planned to give it: Aguara. This name even sounds cunning, so perhaps it will help protect it.\nJust as I thought, all those feeble, non-lethal security measures were completely useless against warriors set on bloodshed — I've been saying that all along... Thankfully, they did not find the underground chamber, so I can hide out here for another couple of days.\nBut how long can I carry on hiding here? They've stayed put this whole time, and show no sign of retreating. I don't know what they're looking for, but whatever it is, they haven't found it yet.\nMy food's all gone, and I feel as if I am gradually slipping into unconsciousness. Whether I give myself up or stay here, I'm guessing it'll end the same way...\nBut I cannot let go of Aguara. Though I've put the egg into hibernation, I am not sure how long it will last. Ah, Aguara, you impatient little critter. Why the big hurry? Just wait a bit longer... Your time has not come. The Natlan of today is not ready to be your home, not yet...\nSpeaking of home, I do not believe I have returned to visit, nor have I sent a single letter back, not once since I arrived in this place.\nIf only I had listened to Mom and Dad, put my mind into my medical studies and training... Might things have turned out differently? Might I have been able to protect everyone?\nAguara, I wish I could see what you'll look like...

It had been years since they had last met, and he was not only taller now, but dressed in much finer clothes. The latter was hardly surprising — after all, he was now a Recording Officer of the Grand Alliance, and had come to receive the banner of the Flower-Feather Clan in the name of the Holy Sovereign. It was only natural that he would dress well for the occasion. He had changed, she thought, but how could a person not have? The only thing that had not was his sluggishness. \"I assure you that the cook's skills will suit your taste,\" he said, pausing as though he expected a reply. She remained silent, so he continued, \"Once we reach Cinder City and meet with His Majesty...\"\n\nUnable to bear the ceaseless chatter any longer, the dragon let forth a thunderous roar, cutting it short. It could smell that repulsive scent on her, the kind that even all the springs of the south could not wash away. These lowly insects, it thought, puny bugs deluding themselves into believing that they could seize control of these scorching plains through the tricks of a traitorous lunatic. It chased her unrelentingly, intent on piercing her with its claws, smiting her even to the sand with them, though she had avoided out of its presence twice.\n\nShe pretended not to care what he thought, responding only with a gentle smile. He studied her for a moment, hoping to read some subtle emotion upon her lips. As always, he found no trace of resistance on that mask of indifference she wore. Ever had she been so, he mused sympathetically. Since the day they first met, she had always been this way — quiet and compliant, never one to resist, as docile as a Capybara down by the riverbank, accepting without question all that fate had in store for her, the exact opposite of her hard-hearted mother. \"Do not worry,\" he suddenly said. \"Even if they are all gone, I will stay with you forever, until death parts us.\" She looked at him, smiled, and took his outstretched hand, seemingly submissive. \"Until death parts us,\" she repeated his words softly, as if speaking to herself. For the briefest of moments, a crack seemed to appear in that perfect mask of hers, but he did not notice. In fact, he never noticed anything. Poor man, she thought, always so eager to play his role, yet never having been praised for it... What lousy luck.\n\nBut luck was not the deciding factor, merely a footnote in this prolonged hunt. For years now, following the trail of its wicked scent, she had hunted this giant dragon. She understood its vanity and how it could be seduced with words, so certain of its mastery of fate that it was convinced it could resist the inevitable conclusion that awaited. It was this delusional fantasy that had drawn it here, just as her slender fingers now drew the bowstring taut. Perfectly still she remained, eyes fixed upon the approaching beast, its frame so gigantic that it almost filled the cave's entrance, as if it were oil seeping out from a jar. She could feel its gaze, its predatory stare. Standing there, she was nothing to it — as insignificant as a mere insect, a feather caught in the wind. \"What is this place, you insidious weasel?\""},{"id":"Book958","title":"Book958","filename":"Book958_EN.txt","text":"\"This used to be my mother's favorite garden,\" she answered softly, her slender fingers gently caressing a flower, the name of which now escaped her. Her detached tone belied a hidden intensity, flammable as the oil she had buried beneath the warehouse. Purposefully she avoided his gaze, already knowing what he would say — those smug, tired metaphors, those irrelevant words of comfort, well-meaning yet utterly hollow. He would urge her not to grieve too much over what had already happened, trying to convince her to join him in dreaming of a future that would never come. Then, as had happened on countless nights before, he'd reach out and gently touch her cheek, just as she now caressed the flower. Yet she felt agitated, oppressed by the autumn evening's lingering heat and the insects' incessant chirping, so before he could speak, she snapped the flower's stem and turned to look at him. Seeing him surprised, she smiled, then carefully tucked the fiery flower into his gilded collar. \"Come now, let us be off. I'm sure someone will take care of all this.\"\n\nThe dragon hesitated, its eyelids narrowing like sheets of iron as it surveyed the stifling darkness. It had not fallen for her trap, not even for a moment. Yes, she had lured it here, into this narrow cave. But what of it? It looked down upon her with a scorn that was as terrible to behold as its own proud plumage. She was nothing like her mother, not like the archer by whose arrow had pierced its throat decades past, the woman who had driven it into the depths of the dark forest like an alpaca, who had deprived it of the simple pleasure of ravaging human villages — the woman who had earned its hate. No, this trembling whelp before it was nothing but her frail echo who could not hope to stand against its claws, much less her ghastly, fearful fate. Her very existence was a mockery of her bloodline, an insult to the ancient lineage of dragons. What absurd notion led her to lure it here? Such a childish stunt could lead only to her death. It was in this moment that the dragon caught the faintest whiff of a strange smell lingering upon the air. For a brief moment, its thoughts were troubled by a flicker of unease, yet this faded quickly beneath the weight of its arrogance.\n\nPushing open the old wooden door, he caught the faintest whiff of a strange smell, like oil, or perhaps dry wood. He paid it no heed, simply taking her hand and leading her into the dim recesses of the warehouse. No matter what happened, he would guide her forward. Silently, he thought to himself that someday he would lead the entire Flower-Feather Clan the same way. Without thinking, he glanced up at the massive dragon skull suspended above them. He did not remember such a relic having been there before he'd left the Clan, but that was irrelevant. Lianca and her chosen successor were both now dead, and her soft-hearted second daughter lacked the strength to rule the tribe. Only he, who had accompanied that daughter since their youth and was deeply trusted by the Holy Sovereign, was worthy of leading these ignorant people toward the future that the Holy Sovereign had described. Elder Nyamgondho had no objections to this — he too was a child of the Flower-Feather Clan. After the wedding night was over, all opposition would be silenced.\n\nIn that silence, a strange notion stole upon her, like a new and unfamiliar dream. She wondered, what if the young man she had once yearned for, the one who was once her companion, what if he had never left the Flower-Feather Clan, and what if he had not gone to serve the Holy Sovereign, but instead had stayed to witnessed her change, the growth of her defiance — would he have been pleasantly surprised or dejected? The beast's smoldering eyes locked onto her in the darkness, its pulse entwining with her breathing so that the two could no longer be distinguished. An almost imperceptible movement; and with that, a spark shot down the fuse, racing towards the oil barrels not far from where they were."},{"id":"Book959","title":"Book959","filename":"Book959_EN.txt","text":"As soon as they turned the corner, they saw that banner, the symbol of authority. Almost instinctively, he tightened his grip on her hand, a surge of searing excitement rushing through his veins. He did not notice the flame that slipped from between her fingers. Within a moment, a great conflagration began to roar up on all sides, engulfing the entire warehouse, the narrow space transforming instantly into a blazing crematorium. \"Quick, that way!\" he yelled out in panic, yanking her arm as he tried to find an escape route through a cascade of falling flames. Yet the intense heat began to blur his vision. \"There's no way out,\" she murmured softly, allowing him to hold her arm without resistance, just as she always had. \"I've sealed off all the exits.\"\n\nKnowing now that it could not escape, the dragon let out a furious roar, shaking the narrow cavern like a drawn-out roll of pealing thunder. She watched on as it struggled in vain, flapping its wings as if this might extinguish the blistering inferno. But it was too late, and the very desperation of the beast's resistance betrayed it. Containers of liquid phlogiston were shattered by its frantic movements, its flesh consumed by the fire that rained down. Thick black smoke began to rise, suffocating the few remaining dim slivers of light that crept through the crevices in the stone walls, as if it were trying to devour the faint sun of the autumn twilight.\n\nShe struggled on in vain, choked by the black smoke that enveloped them. Crawling over to his side, she clumsily reached out to cradle his face and give him one final farewell kiss. \"Not even death can part us,\" she whispered, attempting to raise a hand which had now lost all feeling.\n\nBut still her hand fell; and with that, the long-taut bowstring let out a piercing twang, a joyful release of pent-up urgency. A feathered arrow shot through the chill of the autumn's evening air, careering towards the giant dragon that writhed in agony among the flames below.\n\nThrough the searing tongues of fire, which at this point had nearly obscured the light of the dusk, she saw a group of people hurrying toward them. She smiled and looked up at the dragon's head, imagining the scene that would ensue when the flames were extinguished, picturing the expressions on the people's faces.\n\nReinforcements from the Flower-Feather Clan, she thought — heroes who had once followed her mother into battle. Even with wings, this dragon she had hunted for so many years now had little hope of escape.\n\nAnd in the end, she thought to herself, there was indeed to be no escape.\n\n\"Dead already,\" muttered Elder Nyamgondho. After wiping from his forehead the beads of sweat that glowed with the light of the burning oil, he pulled down a half-burned curtain from the beam above, then tossed it aside. Around him were the young men who had rushed over to help put out the fire, all at a loss as to how the tightly guarded warehouse could have suddenly gone up in flames. He sighed, then scanned the area again, searching without much hope for a clue to the blaze's origin. But just as before, aside from the two charred bodies, there was nothing to be seen except for the dragon skull that hung high above them — a relic of the beast that she, singlehandedly, had slain some years past. Everything in the warehouse had been burnt to ashes."},{"id":"Book95","title":"Book95","filename":"Book95_EN.txt","text":"—Pressing Official Business—\n\"I am the Great and Glorious General Weiyang, emissary of the imperial court on a royal mission!

Even mercury, which mortals hold to be enduring, through her amber-gold eyes can be seen to wear, tear, and collapse — to say nothing of such fleeting troubles or love.\nIn the endless journey of life, mortals often miss their homeland, and thus wander amidst time's boundless flow, entertaining fantasies that a lost image could be recreated in the future. Though they are driven and pushed by the torrent of the passing years, and when forced to make devastating decisions, they will often look back at the past, perplexed, as though light long-faded might yet return.\nBut not so her.

Lingmeng once worshipped many supernatural beings, walking alongside the spirit elders of fairies, birds, and beasts within the wild mountain. But in that earth-shaking chaotic war a thousand years before, those gods, fairies, and former inhabitants alike disappeared. Even so, the sentimental mountains retained the echoing memories in the Ley Lines, and thus they sometimes repeatedly reappear at dawn or at night, when fog and rain blanket the land.\nSometimes, herb gatherers and jade artisans will lose their way in this fog and encounter these solitary shadows. As the village elders tell it, an encounter with the ancient fallen is often an ill-starred omen, a sign of unexpected disaster. The Ley Lines, having accumulated and accumulated until growing into tumors, bring forth these ancient regrets and miseries into the present world, and that is why there is fog and rain unceasing. And that is also why the mountain people avoid both like the plague, to avoid becoming entangled in spirit by those ancient sorrows.\nEven so, after Rex Lapis completed his great deed of pacifying the land and sea, surveyors from Liyue Harbor would blunder into the fog and rain, disturbing those dreams of old... But that is another tale."},{"id":"Book963","title":"Book963","filename":"Book963_EN.txt","text":"In the days after Rex Lapis brought peace to mountain and forest, a mariner once entered the crisscrossed streams beneath the mountain and became lost in the damp dusk fog. On a bamboo raft, this person passed waterweeds that glowed a faint blue and purple, passed tree and bush bedecked in falling flowers, and followed azure avians never before seen even in dreams, before coming unto and into the cavern of slumber.\nThrough the jade glow and the ghostly light of fungi, the mariner gazed with entranced eyes upon the inhabitants of old. A veritable parade of mountain ghosts they seemed — in ancient cotton robes they were garbed, and the hems of their clothes were adorned with jade as clear as light playing upon the water, and with nameless fragrant plants. Lined up and standing on the bank of a deep pool, they sang a song the mariner had never heard before:\n\"How mine malice lurks lonesome in the dying light of day! How the hateful wind bears the rain, how the deep fog veils!\"\n\"None remain save a lone lord lamenting lost years — alas, alas! You came too late.\"\nSad was the song and quiet, tinged with seeming resentment. The mariner looked closely at the faintly glowing figures in the cavern, and lo, one by one they removed their jades and threw them into the pitch-black pool, as if never having noticed the presence of a visitor at all. Descending despondency drove the mariner's paddle on the return journey to Qiaoying Village, but not before leaving markings along the path.\nIt is said that Yuehai Pavilion would later send surveyors here to search for any mysterious settlements, and some also say that the Millelith once deployed troops into the deep mountains to search for any hideouts of illicit nature, but all without success. When Lan Jing, the famed doctor from Yilong Wharf, was yet a youth, he entered Mt. Lingmeng to explore the legendary, mysterious cavern in search of ancient prescriptions, but after his return, he would never again speak of the matter. It was only following his passing that his family found an inkstone within his personal effects. Legend has it that it was the color of clear waters and bright as the high heavens, and yet, with the doctor's death, the origins of this inkstone could no longer be verified. Much later, the descendants of this famous physician would go bankrupt due to poor management of their merchant shipping business, and thus was this inkstone lost amidst the morass of humanity, its whereabouts unknown thereafter."},{"id":"Book964","title":"Book964","filename":"Book964_EN.txt","text":"Songs have long circulated in Chenyu Vale that tell of an ancient cave within which a demon lord from a past beyond reckoning once hid. They say that she wore a skirt of coagulated jade-blood, and leaned on the long-destroyed lunar chariot, submerged and slumbering beneath a black, bottomless pool of water. In these eons that memory has nigh forgotten, she was the mistress of Chenyu Vale, who ruled the birds and beasts and adepti of wild mountain nature, who controlled the ebb and flow of the Bishui River, who as an arbiter maintained the natural balance between mortals and animals. But those are tales from long ago, and though both folk indigenous and migrant tell tales of how she started a war out of incurable obsession, before ultimately being defeated, sealed, and plunged into deathly, dreaming slumber, the relevant historical details can now no longer be verified.\nThe sole piece of evidence that supports this tale is this song of lamentation that Chenyu Vale locals once sang:\n\"Though I wish to gift you herbs, who shall leave it at the sandbank amidst the waters?\"\n\"Where now fly the godly banners? The chariot is lost in the lightless bamboo wood.\"\n\"How terrible the Xuanwen wail, who think upon the darkened pool.\"\nDo the proud descendants of the mountain folk yet remember and memorialize their lost god? The most vivid tales have been eroded by flowing time, now only faintly visible in song, like green jade only faintly discernable beneath the waters of a stream.

All within the tribe knew why this had happened, and though they did not banish father and son — who had naught save each other to depend on — from their midst, they still feared and shunned them. Kuntur, who then could not even speak, became dragged into all this. Like his taciturn father, wheresoever he trod, the sun would retreat behind a thick layer of clouds, depriving the world of its light. Who, then, could say if the sun's ire would not also fall upon those close to them? None of the tribespeople dared to brave such misfortune.\nKuntur grew all the same, unloved though he was by the sun. But just as the fruits in front of his house were smaller by far than his neighbors, he was a weak specimen compared to other youths his age. This poor child never knew the touch of the warm sun upon his skin, so he was sickly pale as opposed to ruddy as his peers were. But his eyes shone like the stars, just like his mother's. It was those bright, starry eyes that had first drawn his father in, that had driven him to make his foolish decisions, bringing judgment upon himself.\n\"Could any Iktomisaurus not like basking in the sun?\"\nKuntur asked Ukuku one day. Ukuku did not reply, and merely whittled his arrows in silence — though blind, he was a fine hunter still.\nIt was only natural for Kuntur to ask such questions, for in those days, which child of the tribe was not inseparably bound to their Saurian companion? Kuntur thus wished for a companion of his own, but it was evident that no Iktomisaurus would willingly live in the shadows. Though they may be more active at night, we now know that they would never assent to being utterly deprived of sunlight.\nKuntur searched long and hard, but he could not find an Iktomisaurus who loved not the sun to be his companion. As for Ukuku, his father and sole support, he only cared for hunting and feeding his son, giving no thought to Saurian companionship. This was little wonder, for Ukuku's own companion had chosen to be Qoyllor's helper when she left the tribe, returning to the wilds with her. Ukuku had grown used to being without such a companion, just as he was now used to having neither sight nor sunlight. He even thought that Kuntur might also grow accustomed to this and cease asking, and so remained silent in response.\nFortunately, Kuntur was only half alike to his father, or the story would have ended here.\nHe was never the sort to take things lying down — and he was certainly not going to let people make him a laughingstock for failing to find an Iktomisaurus companion. All those children who mocked him received their due reply, albeit with fists rather than words.\nIn the beginning, he always lost, which was quite understandable. He was small, and his fists lacked strength. And as they watched him sit on the ground, dust and dirt caking his face, the children who laughed at him laughed all the harder. But slowly, they no longer did so, nor did jokes at his expense come so freely from their lips. For they found that Kuntur learned quickly, and his strength surged in pursuit of theirs, such that his fists were persuasive indeed, even in the absence of a Saurian companion.\nBut Kuntur was not satisfied with merely reducing loud mockery into low murmuring. He knew now that strength could at least force half-grown children to give the appearance of acquiescence, but he still lacked a Saurian companion of his own and remained unloved by the sun. Though many adults in the tribe were neither hostile nor friendly toward him, he did not like the looks in their eyes.\nAnd so, Kuntur decided to do something remarkable to prove himself. If he did that, no one would ever look down on him again, and surely, there would be a Saurian willing to be his companion.\nHis chance came soon. One day, an old man in ragged clothing came to the tribe, asking for water. The people took pity on him, and one of them invited them into their home:\n\"We are all kind-hearted people here. You must have come from a faraway place, dear guest, so stay and enjoy our hospitality.\"\n\"Indeed, you are all kind people. In that case, treat me to the best you have. I'm starving over here!\"\nThe master of the house did indeed provide the best food to the guest, but seven days and seven nights later, the guest was still not satiated.\n\"Is there anything else? Well, is there? Now, now, don't be shy, serve it all up!\"\nThe master of the house would kindly ask the guest to leave, though not because he had nothing left to be eaten, but because he needed to consider his family and himself.\n\"I have put him up and had him fed and feasted for seven days, proving my kindness of heart. Now, it is someone else's turn.\"\nKindness is a pleasant word, especially when used to describe oneself. And so, the tribespeople gave this ragged old man all manner of things, but none could satisfy his bottomless desire. In the end, all could do nothing but shake their heads, wave their hands, and ask him to depart.\nOnly Kuntur's house did not entertain the old man.\n\"You are a kind soul, too. So, what will you host me with?\"\n\"Hah! No one has ever called me 'kind.' I have nothing to share with you, and even if I had, I shan't give you any. You've eaten, drank, and taken more than enough.\"\nSeeing how Kuntur chased the old man away, many in the tribe could not help but ridicule him again. But none could have anticipated that this old fellow dressed in tatters was the infamous sorcerer Rumi in disguise! Those who had promised him hospitality yet who could not satisfy his appetites, he bewitched with his dark arts, and by the time they awoke from their nightmares, he had long since captured all their Saurians, leading them away!\nMany in the tribe had already heard the terrible rumors concerning Rumi, and while none could say what terrible scheme he meant to carry out with their Saurians, all knew that failing to stop him would bode ill. To seize their Saurians back, the tribe sent forth their three mightiest warriors to challenge him, but they did not return.\n\"Even the best warrior is no match for the sorcerer Rumi without Saurian aid...\"\nAnd just as the tribe had lost their confidence, Kuntur stepped forth to volunteer himself. Yes, him! \"Kuntur, Unloved of the Sun\"! One who had never even gained a Saurian companion! Now, none believed he would succeed, but neither did any bar his path.\n\"Good thing I've nothing to lose. At least he cannot take from me what I never had.\" Thus thinking, Kuntur set out on his journey with great confidence.\nAs Kuntur made his way forward, Rumi's spells summoned up layers of mist to surround the warrior. He knew that Kuntur was hated by the sun, and so, could count on no sunbeams to scatter the mist for him and light the way. But Kuntur had learned the hunting arts from his blind father since he was a boy. Though he was as good as blind, sounds and smells guided the way for him, and the magically manifested mists could not snare him.\nOne ploy having failed, the sorcerer Rumi deployed another, sending forth three talking Pakpakas to come before Kuntur with both threats and temptations. These three Pakpakas were the three warriors the tribe sent forth, who had each been defeated due to their own weaknesses and turned into this form by Rumi. They did not believe \"Kuntur, Unloved of the Sun\" to be superior to them, and so they spoke the very deceptions Rumi had snared them with, attempting to trick Kuntur.\nBut Kuntur would not fall for such trickery. His father had been punished for deceit and betrayal, and so he hated all lies most bitterly, and could always see through them at a glance. Having had their ruse exposed, the warriors were enraged and tried to block Kuntur's path, upon which he had no choice but to persuade them to step aside by force.\nThus did Kuntur pass through numerous trials until he finally found the sorcerer Rumi, and also laid eyes upon the captured Saurians.\nThe sorcerer put his evil arts to use once more, attempting to frighten Kuntur. But even towering waves and running lava could not scare Kuntur, much less these illusory traps made through spellcraft, so akin to the fog he had encountered at the bottom of the valley earlier.\nHis wicked spells had no effect on Kuntur, but the captured Saurians were not similarly immune, and so Rumi used his spellcraft to turn them to his service. Yet, he did not expect even them to not be a match for Kuntur.\n\"Your fists are tougher than the hardest stones I've ever seen!\"\nNo one would want to go hand-to-hand against such fists, and Rumi was no different. Realizing that he was on the back foot, he no longer cared for the Saurians he had stolen from the tribe. Turning into a cloud of smoke, he fled in defeat.\nCapable though Kuntur was of discerning the sorcerer's traps and lies, he could do nothing against his foe now that he had turned into smoke. But how could he back down? He intended to prove himself to everyone in the tribe by doing this extraordinary thing. And so, he made up his mind to capture Rumi, no matter what it took or what he had to do.\nAt that moment, he saw the still-bound Iktomisaurs, and he thought, since Rumi had been able to command them using mystical arts, perhaps he might use force to compel an Iktomisaurus to help him track Rumi's down and pick out his manifestation.\nThe poor creatures were still under the influence of the spell as he unshackled them, and so they struggled and screamed. It took Kuntur a lot of effort to calm them down. And as to which was the bravest of the lot, Kuntur had recognized it at a glance.\n\"Alright. Now then, you're coming with me, and we're going to track down Rumi the sorcerer — for my honor... Uh, and also for the warriors who were turned into Pakpakas.\"\nThe Iktomisaurus seemed unconvinced and tried to break free, but Kuntur held it fast, and it could not move. Yet, looking into the creature's sad eyes made even fearless Kuntur shudder. Of course, he could tame the Saurian this way, but were he to do so, how different would he be from the wicked sorcerer? So, after only a moment's hesitation, he made up his mind.\n\"Fly, then! Go where you please.\" The Iktomisaurus spread its wings and flew off the moment Kuntur let go, swiftly disappearing over the horizon.\nAnd so Kuntur went in pursuit of Rumi alone. The released Saurians could not speak human language, of course, and glory unwitnessed is no glory at all. Thus was Kuntur's first step on his journey to prove himself also his most anxious one: For Rumi had long transformed into smoke, drifting far away to places unknown.\nHe had also heard the rumors that the tribe's storytellers and well-informed messengers had brought of Rumi, and guessing that he might turn into an animal to avoid pursuit, he wrestled Long-Necked Rhinos and stared down grasshoppers all along his path, but to no avail. It seemed that without an Iktomisaurus companion's aid, the search for the sorcerer would be like searching for a needle in a haystack.\nBut Kuntur had inherited more than just star-like eyes from Qoyllor, and just as his mother had once wandered the wilderness, searching tirelessly for star-shard traces, Kuntur too did not despair of the chase for Rumi, and the confidence he had set out from the tribe with never dimmed.\nUntil the day he heard a familiar cry. It was that of an Iktomisaurus he recognized. Indeed, it was the one he'd released, the boldest in the tribe, one who also lacked a companion. It had left him, but now, it had returned. We do not know why it did so, but we can be sure that Iktomisaurs are most intelligent creatures who choose their partners. Surely, then, Kuntur had earned its recognition, which is why it returned and willingly showed Kuntur the way.\nWith the aid of an Iktomisaurus, even the wily Rumi was no match. The sorcerer even attempted to take a Brown Deer's form to escape Kuntur, only to find that the hunter was just as swift as he.\nOn the brink of being caught, Rumi transformed into a capybara and dived into the water. How secretly pleased he was with himself then, for he thought that Kuntur might not be a good swimmer. Surely, he would escape! Yet Kuntur's Iktomisaurus companion was not merely brave, but blessed with wisdom as well. It flapped its wings in the air, summoning forth a cyclone. Kuntur rode that wind, and his footsteps grew swift and light, as if his feet had grown wings — giving him speed no less than that of Rumi, now a fast-swimming capybara.\nShocked, Rumi leapt out of the water, transforming into a bird that immediately made for the skies above... Which wasn't a good move, if you ask me. If this had been the Kuntur of yesterday, he would have had no choice but to give up, but today, things were different. His Iktomisaurus companion carried him up and up through the clouds, and at last, they caught the cunning sorcerer. Realizing that there was no way out, Rumi simply turned himself into a giant rock. Surely, Kuntur could do nothing about him now! Yet the young warrior grabbed the giant rock and would not let go, crying, \"Fly! Higher, my friend, higher!\"\nAnd so higher and higher they flew, until they soared above the very highest cloud layer, and there, Kuntur beheld the sun for the first time. But before he could say anything, the sun brought forth cloud layers, more and thicker, to surround them. Kuntur and his companion had no choice but to try to find a way out, bursting through the thunder, rain, and storm in the cloud layers as they went. The great heights were frigid indeed, with even Kuntur's eyelids swathed in frost, while the rock that Rumi had transformed into was frozen solid — never again would his foul magic wreak havoc.\nHaving overcome trial after trial, Kuntur and his companion returned to the tribe, telling everyone about their marvelous experience. After that, the stone that Rumi had turned into was placed in a suitable location. The three warriors who had been turned into Pakpakas by the sorcerer were themselves restored to human form. As before, they gave Kuntur a wide berth, but out of shame and regret rather than disgust and fear, for had they not thought then to use despicable lies to trick him?\nThus did Kuntur prove himself to his tribe and win glory. But more importantly to him, he finally had an Iktomisaurus companion of his own!"},{"id":"Book966","title":"Book966","filename":"Book966_EN.txt","text":"<image name=UI_ReadPic_121099/>\n\n...\nLog No. 97:\n...The experiment was a failure.

It glows when active, and has a varied set of attacks.

I've seen relics of a similar style in Nod-Krai. Perhaps the little island we live on is like a big ship, and was once linked to Natlan, only to be dragged off northward by some gargantuan deep sea creature with its fins, claws, or tentacles... or something, which might explain why the area in which we can find similar things is so tiny.\n(This must be kept secret from Katya, alright? When I get back, and you get a bit better, we'll go to the island of the Frostmoon Scions and compare the relics there to my pictures of this giant device. We'll see how similar they are then... and of course, we'll have to find a good alibi to present to Katya, alright?)\n\nGiant Centaur Statue\nA stone sculpture known as the Legatus Golem. It stands with its head held high, a shield in its left hand and a sword in its right, like a forgotten work of art in an ancient castle that has suddenly come to life. He (or perhaps \"it\"?) tramples his base in a cloud of shattered stone and dust, but it waits for the dust to settle before it starts attacking — an honorable opponent indeed. Its moves are also very different from those of your average mechanical monster. Sometimes, you can almost imagine it giving orders to charge like a military commander, and at others, it almost seems to be playing a melody. I'm no good at music, though, so if there was any significance to the tune, I wouldn't hear it anyway.\nI've heard that there are ruins of sunken Remuria in still deeper regions of the sea. Though I wasn't able to visit them this time, I did collect quite a number of legends and related texts, which I'll have to find the time to commission a merchant caravan to bring back. I know you've always loved stories of these ancient kingdoms, and I hope you'll enjoy these.\n\nGiant Ball of Water\nThe Hydro Tulpa is a humanoid creature formed through the coalescence of water. It has neither a fish tail nor legs, very different from the purewater spirits that Katya's told stories about, but its upper limbs and head are human-like, while the latter and its joints are covered in a blue-white shell that resembles armor. In combat, it summons smaller balls of water, miniature versions of itself, to assist it, and will sometimes swallow those smaller water-balls to enhance its own strength.\nI've heard that Fontaine's waters are very special, which is why it can birth Oceanids capable of speech. But it seems that the Hydro Tulpa cannot speak, or does not wish to. Or perhaps we just don't understand its words...\n\nGiant Crab\nA giant crab with the cool title, \"Emperor of Fire and Iron.\" Legend has it that, being an Armored Crab, it habitually searches for suitable shells to wear as armor as it grows, and that if it is not stopped, it might grow indefinitely, even to the point that it could someday wear the Palais Mermonia (the biggest structure in Fontaine City, a place where every building is huge!).\nBut it seems that at some point in time, someone named Basil Elton defeated it, which might explain how its inexorable growth was brought to a halt. I think it's big enough as it is, to be perfectly honest.

Refined and elegant, this young man trained himself assiduously in both the cultural and martial arts, garnering the respect of his peers. One day, while visiting the home of the illness-stricken Emon no Kami, \"Chief of the Gate Guard,\" Takehiko chanced upon the Chief's only daughter, a young lady named Sayohime. In the prime of her youth, Sayohime was as graceful in manner as she was beautiful to gaze upon, her every smile and gesture flowing with innate elegance and natural grace. It was love at first sight for both, and so deeply were they enamored that they secretly pledged their lives to one another behind her father's back, planning to formally propose their marriage as soon as they came of age.\n\nThe years slipped by, yet before long, rebels began to stir up trouble. Takehiko resolved to follow the Shogunate's orders and join efforts to quell the rebellion. Upon hearing of his decision, Sayohime rushed to meet him. Tearfully, she said:\n\n\"You will soon depart for the war, with no promise of when you may return. The battlefield is perilous, and I shall be cursed to wait alone. If you truly love me, then stay by my side, and grant me the honor of being your bride. I harbor no grand ambitions for glory, prestige, or wealth, and only wish to spend our lives together, happy, and in health.\"\n\nAfterwards, Sayohime recited a poem on the spot, which may be translated as such:\nHow deep the suffering, how bitter it is to yearn. My sleeves are soaked through with anguished tears.\nLike autumn's morning dew, I will scatter as dust in the mirror for you.\n\nBut Takehiko was unswayed by her plea. He replied:\n\n\"Do not mourn our parting, beloved, it is but temporary. If I lived a thousand lives, for you I would keep my loyalty. We are born into the world in our proper time and age.

I will return from battle with victory in my wake, then your hand in eternal union — our marriage — I will take.\"\n\nHaving said this, Takehiko gifted to Sayohime a hand mirror of exquisite craftsmanship to be held by her during their wedding. He too bequeathed unto her a poem, which may be translated as such:\nThough my long quest may have no end in sight, neither does this oath to my future bride.\nThough the earth may see us a thousand miles apart, we share the same starlight that binds our loving hearts.\n\nAnd so they were separated; and so did months pass. A rumor spread of the defeat of the Shogunate's army, and how many soldiers had been grievously wounded or slain. The news devastated Sayohime, who took ill in her despair, and before long died of a broken heart. Takehiko returned from the war a hero, only to hear of his beloved's tragic passing. Wracked with uncontrollable grief, Takehiko made offerings to her with incense and fruits every single day.\n\nHowever, perhaps because she perished with such intense longing in her heart, burial proved insufficient to lay Sayohime to rest. Instead, she became corrupted by the Abyss, returned to the mortal realm as a demon, and visited Takehiko in the dead of night. Though she retained the youthful beauty of her corporeal visage, her new form had been stripped of vitality. All that remained of the tender hands that used to caress Takehiko's cheeks were bony appendages, darkened by death. Takehiko was a samurai, but the sight of this apparition sent him screaming in fear from his bed. He fled to the riverbank, begging a boatman to save his life by ferrying him across to the other side. By the time Sayohime caught up, no boats remained by the water's edge, so she leapt into the river, her legs turning into fishlike fins, and gave chase.\n\nAfter fleeing to Mt. Yougou, Takehiko, with magic learnt from the bake-danuki, hid himself inside a stone. There were as many stones scattered across Mt. Yougou as there were stars in the heavens. No matter how hard she tried, how could Sayohime possibly hope to find him? Just as she was at a loss, she dropped the hand mirror that Takehiko had gifted to her, all those months ago. It shattered on the ground, its shards all reflecting the stone that Takehiko had hidden himself within.\n\nHugging the stone close, Sayohime wept bitterly as she expressed her undying love for Takehiko. She begged him to remember the oaths he had made to her, but Takehiko was still too frightened to reveal himself. At her wit's end, yet unwilling to be separated from her beloved once more, Sayohime turned herself into a raging ball of flame, consuming both herself and the concealed Takehiko, till they were naught but ashes.\n\nAfter finishing the tale, with great interest my friend asked me what I thought of it.\n\n\"Speaking from our Fontanian perspective,\" I answered, \"I find it doubtful that Takehiko truly loved Sayohime. The lovers we sing of in our operas are inseparable, even in death. If one should pass, loyalty would drive the other to join them. From Drest and Adsiltia's promise, to the duel in Tancrede et Chariclea, and even the farewell between Coppelius and Coppelia, this trope is a constant. If memory serves, we've an old fable that defines love like so: Even after all flesh, bone, and entrails have been sliced away, I still lie nestled with you in the marrow that remains. Takehiko promised a thousand lifetimes to Sayohime — even if she was corrupted by the Abyss, he should have joined her in eternal slumber. As a proud samurai of Inazuma, Takehiko should know the value of promises and oaths better than any of us.\"\n\n\"Well, that's not wrong. In Inazuma, many people see Takehiko as a coward and a traitor to his beloved. However, it is not because he didn't return Sayohime's feelings. Rather, when faced with a demonic entity from the Abyss, Takehiko chose to run and hide inside a stone instead of offering her salvation. In the end, he was revealed by the very mirror he gave to her, and was burned to ashes. I suppose that's karma,\" my friend said while refilling her cup of tea. She continued, \"It is said that this tale was originally inspired by a novel from Liyue. In that story, the protagonist never betrayed their lover, and the two were unable to meet for a long time because of the interference of evil-doers who transformed the girl into a monster and imprisoned her beneath a stone... Well, that's a bit distant from this version of the tale. What I'm more curious about is what'd you do if faced with similar circumstances. Suppose I was turned into a monster by the Abyss, and started haunting you, begging you to keep telling me stories...\"\n\n\"If your first instinct after being turned into an Abyssal monster was to come find me for storytime, that'd mean you were completely fine. After all, you're much more of a handful than Sayohime was in the story. Anyway, Miss Usa... I just so happen to have finished this cup of tea. Would you mind getting me a refill?\""},{"id":"Book999","title":"Book999","filename":"Book999_EN.txt","text":"The Yumekui-Baku\n\nA long, long time ago, there lived an elderly couple near Konda Village. Although they were poor and their lives were hard, they remained compassionate, and so earned the respect of their neighbors.\n\nOne snowy day in winter, the old man of the house went into the mountains to gather firewood. He came across a plump little beast entangled in a hunting trap. No matter how much it struggled, it could not break free. It could only squeal in distress — a heart-wrenching sight, if ever there was one.\n\n\"Poor thing!\" the old man thought, his heart full of sympathy. \"How unfortunate for such a young boar to be caught in a hunter's trap like this. So small, it wouldn't even make a good meal... What a waste of life. Let me lend you a hand!\"\n\nSo the old man put down his axe and helped the wild boar undo the ropes that had caught it by the trotters. The little boar squealed and ran several joyful laps around the old man, before running back into the forest.\n\nAfter collecting enough firewood and returning home, the old man told his wife about what had happened. She was pleased to hear it, and said: \"Well done, dear! Once that wild boar grows up nice and fat, we'll catch it and have ourselves a feast!\"\n\nThat night, the elderly couple were just about to sleep when they heard a knocking at the door, along with the gentle, mellifluous voice of a young woman:\n\n\"Excuse me! Is anyone home?\"\n\nHow could there be someone outside in a snowstorm as harsh as this? The old woman rushed to throw open the door, revealing a girl who looked to be around seventeen or eighteen years old, braving the wind and snow. Her beauty was striking — though dressed in humble garb, she had a natural radiance, not unlike an adeptus straight out of a Liyue fable. Seeing this, the old woman was overwhelmed with pity, and cried out:\n\n\"Mercy me! Such snow, you must be freezing! Come inside, let's get you all warmed up. I don't know whose daughter you are, young lass, but what brings you here so late?\"\n\n\"I'm truly sorry to disturb you at such a late hour. My parents, unfortunately, have passed away. According to their will, I was to seek out a friend of my father's... But I didn't expect to run into weather like this, and I ended up getting lost in the snowstorm. If you two would be so kind as to let me stay the night... I don't mind sleeping in the corridor, or even in a storeroom.\"\n\nHearing her story, the elderly couple took pity upon the poor girl, and let her stay in their house, giving her both food and a bed to sleep in. Perhaps because of this good deed, both the old man and woman were graced with beautiful dreams that night.\n\nIn the days that followed, the snowstorm did not cease, and the elderly couple continued to let the young girl live with them. During this time, the girl tended to the couple's daily needs. Both diligent and considerate, she completed each task with meticulous attention to detail. The old man and woman were delighted.\n\nOne day, the girl suddenly said to the elderly couple:\n\n\"As I mentioned, before my parents passed away, they entrusted me to a friend of my father's. Yet though they are a family friend, I have never met them. I don't know what kind of person they are, or if they're willing to accept a burden like me into their life. You've taken such good care of me all this time, and I don't know how I could ever repay the favor. If you would not object, I would love to be taken in as your daughter. Although I'm just an ordinary girl, I'm willing to do my best, however little that may be, to look after the two of you from here on out.\"\n\nHearing her words, the elderly couple were overjoyed. Having no children of their own, they had suddenly gained a daughter who was both intelligent and considerate. They could ask for no better blessing. From then on, the old man and woman treated the girl as if she were their own daughter, and she returned the favor in kind. Whether in front of others or in private with her new family, she was the very picture of filial piety.\n\nAfter some time, one morning, the girl offered the elderly couple a tray of irresistibly delicious-looking pastries, the likes of which they had never seen before. She said:\n\n\"While you were sleeping, I made a little something, following a recipe passed down by my family. Please, take these pastries to the town and sell them in the market — I'm sure they'll be very popular.\"\n\nJust like the girl had said, the miracle pastries were a roaring success among the wealthy merchants of the town, and sold for a fittingly high price. From then on, every morning, the girl would make some pastries for the elderly couple to sell. With the profits rolling in, the family began to prosper.\n\nAfter this had happened several times, the elderly couple could not help but be curious. How could their daughter make such exquisite delicacies when all they had in their house was flour, and ordinary flour at that? Eventually, they could no longer contain their curiosity. That night, when the girl was making her pastries, they spied on her through a crack in the door. Yet their adopted daughter was nowhere to be seen; only a plump little beast, using its snubby nose to snatch floating dreams out of the air, then turning them into pastries. The elderly couple were shocked, and the little beast, sensing their presence, quickly reverted to the familiar form of their daughter. Throwing herself down at their feet, she cried:\n\n\"I am terribly sorry to have frightened you, my dear benefactors! Since you have already seen my true form, I shall not keep my secret any longer. In truth, I am the baku that you rescued on the mountain, all those days past. In order to repay your kindness, I took on the appearance of a young girl and sought you out. I've been taking your nightmares and turning them into pastries, so that you may sell them for a good price.\"\n\n\"Oh my!\" cried the old man. \"You're that wild boar from back then!\"\n\n\"Firstly, I am a baku — well, technically speaking, a 'mo' — from Liyue, not a wild boar. Secondly, since you now know my true form, if word of this spreads, my mistress — the one who oversees countless sweet dreams and nightmares — will surely not look kindly upon my recklessness. The two of you might also be implicated because of me. I am truly grateful for all the care you've shown me in the days I've been here, and I am sorry for having caused you such trouble. Even so, my wish to become your daughter was sincere... Though I am afraid such a request is likely impossible in this lifetime. So please, allow me to bid you farewell.\"\n\n\"A baku, you say? A mo...? Nope, never heard of it. Ah, I don't care if you're a human or a wild boar, you're still our darling daughter!\"\n\n\"I am truly thankful for your kind words. But if others learn that there is a baku here, it might spell disaster in the near future. Also, I am a baku, not a wild boar.\"\n\n\"Bah, what's that got to do with anything? If you don't tell anyone, nobody'll even know you're a... What was it again? Bakumo, right? Also, rearing wild boars is hardly something out of place around here!\"\n\n\"That does make sense, when you put it like that. But remember, I am a baku, not a wild boar.\"\n\nAnd just like that, the young baku stayed by the elderly couple's side. With their daughter's delicious pastries to sell, the old man and woman spent their twilight years in comfort and prosperity. And they all lived happily ever after."},{"id":"Book99","title":"Book99","filename":"Book99_EN.txt","text":"—Legacy of a Goddess—\n\"Your deeds have saved the people.

But seeing how their eyes sparkled, she believed that these toys must be related to some wondrous emotion.\nThough she had not figured out just what this emotion might be, this beautiful possibility did soften her heart a little.\n\n\"Shenhe seems very interested in toys.\" This was the conclusion Xianyun came to from observing Shenhe gazing at the toy store as if in a daze.\nHer disciple, she knew, had lost her family when young, and had trained under her wing ever since, and thus opportunities to access toys had been few and far between.\nNow that Shenhe had returned to live amongst humans, and she herself had taken their form to do so, she found as she grew more accustomed to the lives of mortals that Shenhe had indeed lacked many opportunities for joy compared to human children.\nAnd was it not her responsibility as master and elder, she thought, to accompany her disciple for a jaunt at the toy store?\n\n\n\"Master seems very fond of toys,\" Shenhe reflected as she and her master Xianyun, at the latter's insistence, spoke to Granny Shan for the sixth time.\nIn truth, she did not quite understand the charm of these little window decorations or firecrackers.\nHer master would often use sigils to create various colorful birds to decorate her abode. They were more vivid and lifelike than these decorations, and lovelier by far. And as for the crackling and popping of the firecrackers, they were quite crude compared to the adeptal melodies she was used to.\nIn truth, the toys themselves had but limited appeal to her, for what she actually liked was the smiles on the children's faces as they looked upon them.\nBut her master seemed very interested indeed, asking about all manner of details regarding the toys, from the crafting methods to the tricks behind releasing firecrackers. Finally, her master asked her what sort of toys she liked.\nShe believed that her master's interest must have some meaning behind it, and so she answered honestly. Then, she looked upon her master's calm, thoughtful, but silent face.\n\n\"Shenhe does not, in fact, like toys,\" Xianyun realized at last, after several visits to the toy stores.\nIf not, that gentle expression she saw on Shenhe's face as she stood in front of the toy store should have appeared at least once as she spoke with Granny Shan at length about the little imperfections in the latter's use of paper in window decorations, about improvements to firecracker casings to improve child safety, to the point she had completely earned the old lady's admiration.\nWhat her disciple needed was perhaps not toys themselves.\nA human's childhood and youth pass by in but the blink of an eye, and those who pass on shall never return. What, then, should she do as an elder?\nLantern Rite was fast approaching, and human custom dictated that festivals were a good opportunity to accept gifts.

Yes, that might do.\n\n\nShenhe did not realize her master's intent until she and Ganyu had received their Lantern Rite gifts from her.\nShe had felt no sense of regret about standing in front of the toy store, but her master's kindness was surprising all the same.\nIt was at that moment, when she took the long dress from the gift box her master handed to her and caressed its smooth hem that she understood how those children felt upon seeing those toys.\nBoth she and her master had changed much upon coming to the mortal realm — perhaps the future held still more pleasant surprises of this sort.\nHer future would be full of opportunities to make up for all the laughter lost and joy she had missed out on in the past.

Even when she is spotted on her brief days off, one cannot help but worriedly picture her doing overtime till she practically falls asleep standing up, or wonder if she might suddenly do an about-face and make a beeline to take care of the nearest article of urgent business.\nXianyun saw all this, of course, and had long been considering countermeasures. Just as well, then, that Lantern Rite was imminent, and a suggestion that she had heard on the streets came to mind:\n\"A change of clothes may make for a change of mood...\"\nThus did the adeptus retrieve a machine she had sealed in storage for many years. Using it, some of her friend Ping's best Silk Flowers, and the dyes made using divine herbs from her abode, she weaved several bolts of fabric and satin of immaculate quality and color. As for the exquisite hair ornaments and pendants, they were made of the same material as her adeptal machines. Elegant, lovely, and infused with faint fragrance.\nThen, Xianyun brought the fabric and satin to one of the finest tailors in Liyue Harbor, though she did give the poor artisan quite a fright — after all, any ordinary valuation would appraise these materials at a price point somewhere around \"couldn't get more expensive if you'd just melted Mora down and spun it into silk.\"\nXianyun was pleased indeed with that reaction.\n\"One's disciple has worked many years at Yuehai Pavilion — a figure of standing and repute, surely, and more than worthy of such finery!\"\nOf course, Xianyun did not mention the unique aspects of the fabric or the accessories when she gave Ganyu this gift, mentioning only that the tailor's craftmanship had satisfied her.\nNonetheless, Ganyu could intuit the value of the raiment and the thought her master put into its impeccable artisanry from how the garment seemed to flow like water in her hands.\nAnd so she changed out of her usual working clothes and came out, light of heart, to meet the adeptus and her gathered friends, and at that moment her mood did quietly change—\nAs the clear starry night sky, as a tranquil scene of fragrant blossoms.\n\"Putting duty aside to spend a carefree Lantern Rite with everyone...

Instead, she kept searching for more specific knowledge to find a way to turn the prophecy into reality.\nHer aim was to bestow a magical blessing upon the origami inhabitants by staging a grand yet heartfelt dance, and in doing so, resolve the crisis once and for all.\nAnd just as she wished, the rest of the story played out in the mildest manner imaginable.\nAll their waiting had not been in vain, their perseverance rewarded finally with a happy resolution.\nLong after leaving the dreamlike realm of Simulanka, the emotion of that time still resides within this dress; even now, as Nilou dances, the joyful fragrance of ink lingers upon every breath that she takes.\nYet Nilou never wondered why she was chosen as the Forest Fairy—\nPerhaps her so-called blessing was this — in a future as deep and distant as the night sky where good and evil coexist, she lit up a star to show people how to find their way through the most beautiful of thoughts.\nIf this blessing had been conceived by someone who approached every moment in life with gentle-heartedness, this star would have shined with a limited brilliance, a light that would often have failed to penetrate the complex nature of reality.\nOnly one who was as pure as the morning dew, listening to the unsullied kindness of their inner voice, could have offered up such a sincere, effective blessing that would be accepted by the world."},{"id":"Costume340018","title":"Costume340018","filename":"Costume340018_EN.txt","text":"Simulanka's rules dictate that the essence of all life in it must conform to the image created by the Goddess of Fate.\nIn other words, Kirara's intrepid manner corresponds to a certain character in the fairy tale that the goddess penned.\nHowever, despite her — and your — travels all across Simulanka, you never heard the tale of any such itinerant hero.\nConfused, you asked the detective, for you knew that he had heard the goddess's voice, and was the keeper of a great many secrets.\n\nAnd so, from his lips you drew this tale—\nAmongst the multitude of creatures, the cat was favored of the goddess, such that she even tried to create a realm just for them within Simulanka.\nAs in her great plan, this new realm would be filled with feline residents of all sizes and fur colors.\nHere, happiness would be distributed according to principles of balance, and every resident's happy smile would be perfectly calibrated.\nThe cats would never feel sad, and the worst their mood could be was similar to \"as if a furball was tickling their throat.\"\nHowever, they would never be able to cough it out no matter how hard they tried, for that would be a negative emotion that they could never make manifest.\nWith eternal, unchanging joy, and sorrow unable to be birthed, the scales of the heart were not balanced — nor was this setting.\nYet the goddess's attention was divided amongst her other manuscripts, and so this story was put on hold even as it waited to unfold.\n\"Stories, at their heart, yearn to make sense,\" or so the goddess is rumored to have said to herself after the fact.\nWhen internal contradictions are not resolved, the pattern of the plot's progression can become perverted, seeking to resolve these absurdities itself.\nThus did an itinerant feline heroine appear in the corner of the draft manuscript and, while the goddess was distracted, escape between the margins.\nShe stole wrath, tears, and sorrowful sighs from other pages in the manuscript, and she distributed them in every street throughout the country of cats.\nThe residents' smiling iron masks began to melt, and they began to diverge from the predetermined paths fate had written for them.\n\"A cat's true nature is to be willful and free,\" the crafty heroine declared.\nThe goddess was not displeased at this interdiction by one of her creations. If anything, the heroine's defiance caused her to make a decision.\nShe would leave this imperfect idea, now put to paper, be. The realm of cats should indeed be a freer place.\n\nNo wonder, then, that you could find no trace of this gallant cat, for that rebellious figure never slipped out from the paper folds, but could only exist in the world's blueprint memory.\nAs you were deep in thought, you caught a glimpse of Kirara's bright eyes. She seemed truly taken with this tale.\n\"Heh, guess I know why I'm dressed like that itinerant heroine now!\"\n\"Isn't that just because you happen to be a cat?\" So you thought, but you did not voice it.\n\"The heroine brought everyone's missing desires back to them — don't you think that's a lot like what a courier does?\"\n\"Delivering everything your customers need to them, and making sure they're satisfied...\"\n\"At their core, both jobs are pretty much the same!\"\nKirara's tail stood up proudly as she said these words.\nHer passion for delivering goods moved even you, and so you accepted the proposed equivalence, even though it remained unclear if Simulanka's rules would uphold such a statement.\n\"That's right.

If this was before, I'd probably have tumbled all the way into a pool of lava that just happened to be there.\"\nBennett pulls a silly face, and grins, \"But this time, I just stumbled a bit, then sat down on top of this rock.

Yet, dwelling too low vexed him, as his gaze yearned for the ocean some distance away, a view that brought peace to his heart.\nAnd so, he picked a place betwixt and between, laying his few private possessions there. In this world of humans, where he was neither master nor thrall, claiming a room of his own seemed to be the first grand choice he'd ever made.\nHe once believed the need for such contemplations would not come around again until the Melusines gradually joined the Marechaussee Phantom. Their human comrades, who lived far from the Court of Fontaine, could choose to live in staff dormitories provided by the Palais Mermonia. Melusines working here enjoyed the same rights.\nActing out of a protective nature, Neuvillette naturally wished for the Melusines to dwell on a floor adjacent to his own. If they reside just one story above, he could easily trace their comings and goings by the gentle patter of their feet upon the stairs.\nBut then, quick as a wink, a thought bloomed in his mind. Perhaps the Melusines might not wish for such scrutiny. Moreover, some of the cases he'd handled reminded him that kindness, when piled too high, could brew a cauldron of woes.\nIn the end, he decided to let the Melusines choose for themselves, just as he had done upon first arriving in the Court of Fontaine.\nThe Melusines, with hearts full of joy, picked a floor beneath his. \"It's but a skip and a hop from where Monsieur Neuvillette and our human colleagues live. Should the alarms ring, we can answer them with even greater speed. How very convenient!\"\nAs time spun on, fortunes both glimmering and grim did befall. Deep within his heart, in a place untouched by knowing, perhaps he chided himself for deeds beyond his grasp.\n\nAs the Dragon of Water, he had always believed that he bore a certain responsibility for this primordial world. And as this world slowly unfolded before him, and he finally accepted the place he now occupied, that sense of responsibility ceased to be a grand, abstract ideal, becoming instead a series of very real duties that needed to be fulfilled.\nOr, to put it more bluntly: born in this manner, however unwilling he might have been to admit it, he was bound to enter the present age — and, in time, feel the stirrings of a desire to do something within it.\nLike now, for example, Neuvillette thinks, having already taken the Melusines and Pahsiv under his care, \"to fulfill their wishes\" ought to be written into his memorandum — and, while there is still time, treated with the utmost seriousness indeed.\nWith that in mind, he changed into his new clothes. As he walked out of his office, his footsteps rang with certainty.\nHowever, the events that followed soon drifted beyond his control once more. By pure chance, he ran into Sigewinne and Wriothesley, and as he wandered along with the two of them, talking about this and that, he found himself in unforeseen places, acquiring unexpected things.\nHe could not help but wonder whether such a tale of his travels, told upon his return to the Melusines and Pahsiv, would delight them. Neuvillette found himself anxious, fearing that a journey taken so freely and without plan might lack order — and that, in doing so, he might fail to live up to their kindness.\n\"...Say, Head Nurse, have you ever felt that being overly responsible can, at times, be a kind of 'arrogance'?\" Thus spoke Wriothesley, while Neuvillette was lost in his own thoughts. Perhaps he was reading too much into it, but when the Duke addressed Sigewinne, he seemed to throw a glance in his direction.\nNeuvillette was startled. That was exactly the sort of person he was. Mere praise left him unbothered, for to him they were nothing more than a part of polite human interaction. But a \"critical\" remark like this would send him into a flurry, making him wonder whether he had once again done something odd — soaking himself to the bone in a downpour came to mind.\n\"Then I think you can afford to be a bit more 'arrogant,' Your Grace, instead of neglecting your work for an entire month,\" Sigewinne said, clearly dissatisfied. \"And perhaps you could take a lesson or two from the Duke's 'modesty,' Monsieur Neuvillette... Ah, another fork in the road.\"\nSigewinne turns to a silent Neuvillette, her face lighting up with a smile. \"Monsieur Neuvillette, which path should we take?\"\n\"Indeed.\" Perhaps pleased by the change of topic, or perhaps with a hint of meaning behind it, Wriothesley also turned to him. \"Quick, Neuvillette, you have three seconds. Which way do you want to go?\"\nNeuvillette stared down the plain, unremarkable fork in the road, as if transported back to countless moments when he had to make a choice. Yet this time, there was not a trace of heaviness in his heart. Perhaps it was the gentle night breeze of this foreign land that made the word \"responsibility\" feel suddenly distant. It had nothing to do with his ancient identity, nothing to do with the expectations of others, and nothing to do with factors beyond his control. Perhaps some things were simply that simple, and he only had to consider what he truly \"wanted.\"\n\"Let's take the path with more people on it.\"\n...Of course, some simple responsibilities couldn't be set aside.\n\"But if there's no shop selling Xiao Lanterns along this path, we'll have to come all the way back to find one.

I need to go higher.\"\nPatting the rock, the girl in blue sprang to her feet, shook her basket, and prepared to climb even farther up the mountain.\nWind swept through, and the bamboo rustled as if sighing in exasperation. How could this girl be so stubborn? She had searched from dusk until dawn, and still she meant to keep going.\nShe strode ahead with long, eager steps, and the bamboo hurried to part to either side, so her arms and cheeks would not be scratched by their leaves. Pressed together, they watched from above as the girl ran and halted, crouched to mutter to herself, and shook her head with a sigh.\nThe bamboo thought to themselves:\nCould this little girl be an adeptus? No, no, that could not be. An adeptus would never slip on a rock, fall over, then spring up in a panic to chase the steamed buns rolling out of her basket, her little orange and yellow companion scrambling after them as well.\nIf the adepti came across a stream, they would leap across with ease. Surely, they would not do as she did, running around in circles until she found a fallen tree, then struggling over it on her hands and feet.\n\"...This one... Right, it treats night coughs. And this one is... Hmm, for insomnia? Yeah, let's grab that, too. That granny has not been resting well lately...\"\nAh, so she must be an apothecary's little apprentice. Poor child. What rare medicine was she searching for, to make her work so hard? Her blue robes were fast becoming a coat of mud.\n\"This one... is it a spice? I'll bring it back for Xiangling to look at...\"\n\"And this... Qiqi picks these often. Yes, I should take some for her...\"\n\"Master likes this flower. I'll bring back a few...\"\n\"Didn't Yanfei say her friend has been looking for herbs from Liyue? This one should be perfect. Let's pack some of it too...\"\nThe falling rain hit the bamboo, and they shook their heads.\nWhat a peculiar girl she was. She had climbed the whole mountain and gathered herbs all along the way, muttering about other people the entire time. Her blue robes gained a muddy hue when she fell, then returned to blue again as the mountain rain washed her clean. She was like a young shoot buried in soil, pushing through rock with stubborn grit, stumbling her way to the surface, and only after a wash of rain did her green show.\nSo, she was neither an adeptus nor a little apothecary apprentice. Rather, she was but an ordinary small bamboo shoot.\n\"...I found it! I found it... Finally...\"\nLooking at the hard-won herb in her hands, Yaoyao dropped to the ground with a thump. Yuegui danced in circles beside her, and the bamboo all nodded in unison. They gathered their leaves close, hoping to shield this little shoot from the falling rain.\n\"But this one... Will it be enough to help with that granny's cough? No, I've got to keep going. We'll find a few more.\"\nThe bamboo were struck with shock. Leaves shook wildly from every stalk, some even falling amidst their stupefaction.\nBut Yaoyao noticed none of it. She dug up the herb, tucked it away, and headed straight on again."},{"id":"DilucLetter","title":"DilucLetter","filename":"DilucLetter_EN.txt","text":"<image name=UI_DilucLetter1 />\nTo the \"Darknight Hero\"\n??? ????? ????? has endured too long your self-proclaimed ????????????? and hypocrisy.

Whether it be the design of the bamboo handle, the patterns on its surface, or the colors of the oil paper beneath beads of water, the umbrella looks in every way exquisite and delicate. Each time I pass through an alley and see such an umbrella outside a store, I often find my thoughts drifting back to a certain event. Rumor has it that there once was an umbrella that sent the whole town aflutter with activity. Here's how the story goes:\"\n\"Hundreds of years ago, during the season of a grand festival, the flowers were in bloom, the foxes were at play, and even the typically stoic Tengu mingled amongst the people. Yet, the most eye-catching oddity was a girl bearing an intricate umbrella while sipping the fine wine of the Oni Clan. As she grew inspired, the young maiden danced like billowing flowers amidst the snow as the moonlight poured down on her. All who beheld her found themselves cheering her on, be they human or youkai. But with the passage of time, the girl went to war with the army and met a most untimely fate. With her passing, her cherished umbrella was offered to a shrine by her loyal subordinates.\"\n\"A daughter to a prominent martial family encountered the umbrella when offering her prayers at a shrine. Hence, she decided to purchase it at full price. The next day, with the skies wet with rain, the girl wanted to seize the opportunity and venture out with her umbrella. However, before she could even get changed, a message was delivered from afar, informing her of her husband's death in battle. Consumed by grief, the girl fell ill and left this mortal plane to seek her lover within the stretch of days. After her funeral, her parents regarded the umbrella she bought as something of a cursed object and returned it to the shrine to be sealed away.\"\n\"Yet, after a few months, new rumors spread. People would claim that, on rainy nights, a previously unknown youkai would stalk the streets. The way the youkai was illustrated made it sound akin to an umbrella, except taller than a man, bearing a single eye, a single leg, and also a long tongue. Should someone walk alone at night, the youkai may just suddenly appear, using its long tongue to lick those that dare pass by. From the perspective of those who live in Fontaine, the youkai presented little threat with its main acts seeming like pranks. That said, few people actually knew what the youkai's true intentions were. This engendered a sense of worry amongst the people who walked the streets. Young maidens dared not to leave home. The elderly sighed, saying if the wise and powerful were not absent, dealing with this youkai would be a trifling thing. At that moment, however, few even knew how to exorcise such a simple being.\"\n\"Later, when a young Shrine Maiden caught wind of what happened, she took the umbrella out from the shrine, and washed it from the tip down using a wooden spoon. As she used a silk cloth to wipe its surface, she said this:\"\n\"'Even should the rains of yesterday cease, tomorrow and the day after remain. If that noble were still alive, your present state would surely be held unacceptable!'\"\n\"Hence, she had the umbrella enshrined in an annex of the temple. Since then, none have heard either hint or whisper regarding this umbrella again.\"\n\"Now, I heard this story from a friend of mine in Inazuma, although I did go around investigating the shrines around Narukami and found no mention of the umbrella being enshrined. When I told this to my friend, she just laughed:\"\n\"'Truly, Mademoiselle Leucade, do you take these kaidan to be the truth?'\""},{"id":"Weapon11424","title":"Weapon11424","filename":"Weapon11424_EN.txt","text":"\nThe knights of Mondstadt, whether it be by coincidence or fate,\nHave as most their distinguished titles and corresponding animal insignia the following two:\nThe first is the title and repute of the Lion, passed down from the first Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius,\nAnd the second, from almost the same period, is that of the Wolf Knight, Boreas.\n\nThere is, in truth, no record at all of the Knight of Boreas.\nThe name's origin instead comes from stories that circulated through the streets at that time.\nAt the end of the tale, the merchant (or farmer) whose daughter was saved asked:\n\"How can we ever thank you, O Honored Knight?\"\nThe Knight replied: \"When thine precious daughter is married, raise a glass in toast from afar.\"\n\"Ah! I am very sorry... if I am to toast you, might I humbly ask your distinguished name, O Knight?\"\nThe Knight thought for a moment, and replied thusly:\n\"Then thou should toast my companion instead. 'Boreas' is his name.\"\n\nThe end of the story often goes something like this:\nAt the same time, in the forest (or on a mountainside, or someplace out of sight),\nA sudden gust of wind blows. The merchant (or farmer) gazed in that direction,\nBut saw only a pair of bestial eyes in the darkness, cold as ice.\nThese two lights quickly disappeared. After the merchant (or farmer) came to, the Knight was gone as well.\nThere are many versions of the story, though the daughter is always saved, and the Knight is always nameless.\n\nBut before the story was a story, he was merely a strange traveler clad in a dust-stained and tattered cloak. Some noticed the exquisitely crafted yet battle-worn armor beneath the cape. But that didn't mean anything. Perhaps the armor's bearer was just another lost soul who had lost their prestigious position with the changes wrought by revolution.\nThe tavern's owner noticed that the man paid with real gold and silver coins, though none recognized the symbols on them. Still, that too meant nothing, for gold and silver have no master and are always changing hands. Nor would anyone speak ill of a customer who paid their tab on the spot and was not prone to rowdy drunkenness.\nFor its part, the story came from a snake demon who arrived on Mondstadt's shores from the sea beyond the horizon, following the current of warmth and peace. In the early days of the Knights of Favonius, when they were still weak, the nameless knight left the city to hunt demons, for the price of a single silver coin. The scent of blood and carrion rotting on the beach attracted thousands of falcons, who circled for days. Thus, the true origin of the name of Falcon Coast comes not from the romantic legend of the Falcon of the West.\nIn the years afterwards, the Knights of Favonius did their utmost to convince the nameless knight to join them, but he never agreed. In reality, the events that corresponded to the story of \"Boreas\" likely happened between the Grand Master of the early days of the founding of the Knights and the nameless knight. The events unfolded such that the Grand Master, having lost patience after being rejected countless times, had the nameless knight surrounded in the street. The two famous lines in the story were likely spoken when the nameless knight \"Boreas\" left, and though the meaning was similar, the tone of both sides was far less civil.\nBut such a story would be exceedingly dull if committed to poetry, and thus talented bards took that dialogue, combined it with a few events surrounding the Knight while he was in Mondstadt, and from that wove a multitude of stories.\nThough he stayed in Mondstadt for but a few years, in leaving, his shadow has ever remained."},{"id":"Weapon11425","title":"Weapon11425","filename":"Weapon11425_EN.txt","text":"\nLegends have it that this ceremonial sword once belonged to a musician, whose name has long been forgotten.\nLayer upon layer of ostentatious decorations and shining gems prove this was no pedestrian instrumentalist.\n\nAccording to the legends, that musician was immensely proud of an ancient, grand symphony, but never played it in front of anybody else.\nFor that music would no longer inspire applause or lamentation in this chaotic world, nor would any trouble themselves to transcribe such a complex composition...\nThere is an opera in Fontaine that portrays his life — Though none know his origins, all understand his tragedy.\nJust like so many of humble origin, he decided his fate in the city to which all waterways lead.\n\n\"Students!

Perhaps one might put this down to natural nobility? It was with this thought that the Crab Demon Emperor would slowly come to accept the truth that all gave it a wide berth.\nJust as the high-and-mighty (or perhaps that was simply how they thought of themselves) humans, this great eminence would often lament that its position precluded having friends (although this might itself might also indicate high-and-mightiness). After all, those clicking crab claws could easily scare those who antagonized you, and cut the threads of fate for those who insisted on doing so. And the hoard of gold coin that the emperor owned, that stood as high as Mont Automnequi, could buy it all the delicious cookies in Fontaine — and that was a life fit for a ruler, was it not?\nBut without good friends to play with it, at once driven to boredom and sadness — which no amount of cookies could cure — the great eminence had to resort to using those great claws to trim seagrass.

Who dares step into my demonic domain? Why have you come?\"\n(Though the Crab Emperor was erupting in flame, he was in truth a little happy, and also afraid. When other sea beings saw him, they would flee on account of his majesty, and so the Emperor had not spoken to anyone for a long, long time.)\n\"Mr. Crab,\" the little Melusine said, \"you don't seem very happy. Let's play together. That'll cheer you up!\"\n\"You do not understand,\" the Crab Emperor began, and though he wished to take the Melusine to task on account of her trespass in calling him \"Mr.\" instead of \"Your Majesty,\" he instead finished, \"an overlord cannot play with little Melusines, or he shall lose his kingly majesty.\"\n\"And what would happen if he loses it?\"\n\"An overlord without majesty is no overlord at all. Were it not for my claws being larger and my armor thicker than that of other crabs, I am ordinary, just like them.\"\n\"Well, Mr. Crab, your claws are bigger than me, and you have more legs than I do. Your armor is thicker than the walls of my house, and other than gold coins and little cookies, you've got so many other nice things. You should be very happy! Hmm, I know. It must be your kingly majesty that makes you unhappy.\"\n\"Little Melusine, you have never been a king, and so I forgive your ignorance. Know that an emperor should not care for his own happiness.\"\n\"But before you were king, you must've been a crab, right, Mr. Crab? Oh, your unhappiness makes me unhappy too! Tell you what — I'll help you give up your kingly majesty!\"\n\"Hah! Little Melusine, you speak of things far beyond your ken. When in history has an emperor given up their rule?\" The Emperor waved his claws in a rage. \"Unless... For example, and just as an example, a hero should defeat the demon lord using their holy blade... That way, even a former overlord must be content playing with the little Melusines.\"\n\"Oh, so that's how it works!\" The Melusine exclaimed happily, before then falling into thought, and saying, crestfallen, \"But I don't know where to find a hero, or where a holy blade might be...\"\n\"Oh, don't you worry! So long as they can defeat the demon lord, anyone can be a hero, and any weapon can be a holy sword,\" the Emperor said hurriedly. \"Mwahahaha! Now do you understand, you impertinent Melusine?\"\n\n\"'...And that's what Mr. Crab told me. Please, everyone, lend me your strength!'\" She said. And all the Melusines in Merusea Village thought that indeed, they should help her! And so they arrayed her with a great seashell for a shield, crowned her with a seagrass laurel, and canvas from a wrecked ship within Elynas they brought for her cloak. At last, they armed her with a rare piece of dried cardboard — her treasured sword.\nThus did the Melusine heroine embark on a journey to defeat the Crab Demon Emperor, and with her peerless magical blade did she cast the marauding tyrant down. And from then on, Mr. Crab, now longer a demon lord, would become the Melusines' good friend...\n\nAfter some discussion, the Melusines reached a consensus.

Han Ce was ashamed of his past actions, but knew not how to redeem himself.\nSeveral years later, Han Wu breathed his last. Thus ended the life of the master craftsman of a generation. Per his father's will, Han Ce retrieved an archive of weapon designs from the study — they were the fabled prototypes.\nThe archive was sealed inside a wooden chest along with a letter addressed to Han Ce.\n\"To my dear son, Han Ce. The world is vast and filled with many marvels. May you always see the wonder in the world, wherever your journey takes you.\"\n\nThe designs were covered in comments penned by his father. Han Ce was overjoyed at the sight and proceeded to peruse them all night long.\nAs Han Ce stepped outside the door of the study at the first light of dawn, he watched in wonder as a meteorite fell from the sky. It crashed down right before him in front of the Han residence, landing perfectly vertical.\nA host of emotions flooded Han Ce's heart. Tears both of joy and sorrow streamed down his face as he cried, \"The heavens have spoken! The heavens have spoken!\"\nHan Ce took the pitch-black aerosiderite and added it to the blackcliff that remained in the forge. Following his late father's designs to the letter, he crafted a pointed pole with a sharp tip that shimmered like ice and a body hard as bedrock.\nHan Ce could have traveled the world with this trusty weapon in hand, but he chose not to. For Han Ce vowed that starting that day, never again would the flames of the furnace die out, and never again would the working of weaponry cease.\n\n"},{"id":"Weapon13405","title":"Weapon13405","filename":"Weapon13405_EN.txt","text":"\nThis crimson polearm has seen countless battles, and has borne witness to a certain gladiator's valor.\nIts ice-cold tip was often drenched in the blood of its foes, to the thunderous applause of the crowd.\nBloodstained was the gladiator's fate, and freedom, so near yet so far, was often balanced on a knife's edge.\nThe dull sound of that crimson tip piercing flesh was many a battle's death-knell.\n\nAs the gladiator's final performance ended, their master spoke up amidst the thunderous applause:\n\"The promised number has been met.

A huge, hulking monster, with a body like a salamander with black and purple body, it took advantage of the other great ancient dragons' absence to sneak in and occupy the empty Great Volcano of Tollan, and began to run roughshod over the people, committing all manner of abuses and outrages, its crimes beyond count, and the various tribes suffered greatly. Fortunately, the black Volcano Lord was completely driven out of Natlan in the end, so kids these days don't need to worry about him getting up to his antics anymore!\nWhat we will speak of today is how the ancient Pyro Archon Cochanina cleverly kicked the Volcano Lord out of the lands of the People of the Springs.\n\nOn that day, the Volcano Lord was lying in his volcano, admiring his own pitch-black body, and scratching his head, when boom! He thought up another outrageously evil idea.\n\"Bleh, it's just so dark down here under the volcano — even darker than a moonless night! Why, I can't even see my own body.\"\n\"I hear those 'People of the Springs' down south have the cleanest, purest water in all of Natlan! If I can throw all the dark, filthy things down here over there and give 'em a good washing, maybe we can clean this place up nice and good! As for those insignificant little tribespeople... Eh, who gives a hoot what they think?\"\nAs the great Volcano Lord thought this, he couldn't help but be immeasurably self-satisfied and rejoice at the idea of getting nice and clean. And so he made the volcano belch out thick smoke, giving him shadows in which to hide, and came among the People of the Springs. Completely and utterly indifferent to the protests of the people and their attempts to stop him, he dumped all his filthy black things — absolutely everything, even the kitchen sink — into the springs. This royally fouled up the air of the entire tribe itself, so that even the Flowcurrent Birds couldn't take it anymore and winged it right outta there one by one.\nIt couldn't go on like that any longer! So the elder of the tribe hauled tail to find Cochanina, who was Pyro Archon, and told her what had gone down.\nCochanina gave a big sigh. This wasn't the first time the Volcano Lord had stirred up serious trouble in Natlan. But alas, the Volcano Lord was just too tough a customer. Though he'd been defeated many times by previous Pyro Archons, he'd always manage to slip away by some fluke, hiding down at the pitch-black bottom of the volcano for a time, before eventually emerging once more. So, Cochanina thought of a plan to drive the Volcano Lord from those lands once and for all. She didn't bring her trusted weapon — the renowned Unu Pachacuti blade — but brought only a surfboard.\nWhen Cochanina arrived before the Volcano Lord, he happened to be leisurely soaking in a hot spring that had already been stained black, jiggling his big round fat belly in circles, looking totally chilled out.\n\"Ah, great Volcano Lord! How can the springs these pathetic little humans use for bathing be enough to wash your precious treasures? Only the ancient, secret treasure left behind by the great hero Uenuku and passed down among the 'People of the Springs,' the 'Iridescent Chalice' from which infinite rainbows spill forth, is worthy of your noble self.\"\n\"Oh?\" The Volcano Lord's interest was instantly piqued. Though the woman in front of him was nothing more than a worthless, inconsequential tribesperson, but her suggestion and humble attitude meant she might be of use. \"In that case, why are you still standing there instead of taking my illustrious self to retrieve that which is rightfully mine?\"\n\"Ah, great Volcano Lord, there is something of which you may not be aware. That treasure is not on land, but is hidden in the depths of the sea. Alas, you don't know how to surf, and we are but puny humans, and cannot make a boat that could accommodate your glorious, majestic form...\"\n\"Hmph! You better not underestimate me!\" The Volcano Lord replied in a huff. He was always like this. Whenever one of those inferior little peons said he couldn't do something, he'd always make a show of insisting he could do it. \"Lead the way! It's just surfing, after all, how could it possibly be hard for one as magnificent as I?\"\nAnd just like that, Cochanina led the Volcano Lord right out towards the deep sea. The clumsy Volcano Lord simply could not compete with the tribe's surfing champion, and could only follow along in her wake, eating the spray her board kicked up. Seeing that he was already dizzy, Cochanina tossed out a Drifting Pufferfish way off into the distance and shouted loudly:\n\"Look! The treasure's right over there! This is the key to opening it!\"\nThe splish-splashing waves made it difficult for the Volcano Lord to see just what she'd thrown, but he was the mighty Volcano Lord, so how could he ever admit he was inferior to humans in any way? And so he charged after the \"treasure\" with a roar, only to end up getting struck right and good by the drifting pufferfish, and was in so much pain he fell right off his surfboard into the sea.\nEven the massive body of the Volcano Lord is but a grain of sand compared to the vastness of the sea, and moreover, there are more terrifying things lurking beneath the waves than he. Anyway, the Volcano Lord struggled sorrily in the sea for a good long while before finally latching onto some reeds, and drifted for a long, long time before he made it back to shore. Though Cochanina didn't manage to get him out of Natlan entirely, the Volcano Lord never again dared to mess with the People of the Springs."},{"id":"Weapon14517","title":"Weapon14517","filename":"Weapon14517_EN.txt","text":"\nLet her eyes be dyed in burning smoke, so she will not be entranced by the colors they reflect.\nLet her ankles be blessed by a flint blade, so she shall not abandon her beloved comrades.\nIn accordance with a ancient, exalted contract, the messenger of night selected a child with a star-bright soul,\nAnd set upon her brow a crown of eagle feathers, to guide the ancient people bereft of form into night's slumber.\n\nWhether it be dragons who drowned in dreams, or saints who contended unceasingly in ethereal realms,\nNone noticed the schemes of the one who claimed to be a sage.

Yet Fukumoto, who was present when the bow was delivered, was deeply inspired by this turn of events and wrote the following excerpt, which would later be included in the book as an appendix.\n\n\"The one who wields this bow, shall be the most adept archer under the command of the King of the Great Red Sand.\"\nIt is as everyone said, and a belief that the prussian green-skinned young man held strongly.

It was a time when the young man had yet to be poisoned by destiny, a time when he still believed that all that he desired were accolades to be won—\nTo him, it was a mere matter of how much effort one had to devote.\nThus, he posed a question to the Ibis King with an easy confidence, \"If I become the most brilliant archer of all, if I possess power and strength surpassing that of the other kings, would this longbow be mine?\"\nSilence fell over the court. In the shadows yet to be illuminated by the lamps, no one dared to answer.\nThere was only one exception: the man atop the throne with eyes as sharp as a falcon's chuckled, and granted the young man's wish.\n\"The day is bound to come,\" the green-skinned youth thought.\n\nBe that as it may, long, arduous years have passed since.\nIt was several hundred years later when the lord of war fulfilled his wish. Possessing the young man who opened the Casket of Tomes, he entered the sealed \"Room of Duels\" again, and only then did he see the longbow held by the phantom.\nIt was as if time stood still, so that the remnant of his soul could pass through the shattered doors and scattered corridors, and return to the chamber of treachery and machinations. Grasping the inescapable golden arrow fired off by the Bow of Secret Rites that was zipping towards him, he saved the body from an unfortunate fate of being impaled through the chest.\nThat had always been part of his plan.\nBut at this moment, the secret ritual dissipated. The arrow was dispelled and the silhouette of the bow-wielder vanished in a flash.\nHe grabbed the longbow before it clattered to the ground.\nHis multiple attempts at seizing this gold-forged bow had ended in failure, which contributed to the rift between him and the Ibis King. Alas, when he finally acquired the treasure that he had long coveted, he found that his heart was as cold as a stagnant swamp, with nary a ripple of joy. The Crocodile King pondered, and concluded that he no longer had such a great yearning to satisfy those unfulfilled desires as he did in his youth.\nMoreover, the revered Lord of the Scarlet Sands had been hidden in many histories, and the Mistress of Flowers had never been seen again. In vying for the mausoleum's throne, strife and chaos broke out amongst the kingdoms. Amidst the turmoil, he took the opportunity to trample the sea of sands in the name of the \"Rite of Duels,\" all to erase the barriers between multitude of worlds and thus incite a frenzied war. To stop him, a lone, elderly figure clutching onto the golden bow, trudged up the steps leading to the ritual...\nThose were but memories of a bygone era.\nHe ran his fingers over the orb on the bow, until it dawned on him that it wasn't dust that was dimming its glow, let alone the fact that this dust was a mere figment of his imagination.\n\n\"Never mind,\" the lord of war thought.\nHe heard the sound of the table being activated again in the \"Room of Duels\", and guessed that the young man whose his remnant soul had once possessed was eagerly waiting for a duel.\nAnd thus he strapped his

They must have some kind of deeper meaning. It is possible that \"Akasha\" would never have come into being without this tradition.\nThere was once a great master Firnas — not the current great lecturer in the Akademiya, mind — who claimed to have many dreams, and to be good at memorizing them. As such, he gained much more repute as a poet and a dreamer as opposed to a researcher or an inventor. Sumeru lacked dreams, and if he truly dreamed much, then he must've been nothing less than a divine appointee, sitting at the Dendro Archon's feet every night. Those jealous of him would thus say that daydreams did not count as dreams.\n\nIt is said that he had witnessed the wind gliders from lands far abroad and realized that their working principles did not follow physical laws at all. If it were not for the Anemo Archon's blessing upon each item, they would be as a millstone even if granted to a mighty eagle, causing it to plummet out of the skies with enough force to smash tortoise shells below.\nThus did this great master Firnas — and once again, I must emphasize that this is not our current great lecturer Firnas — resolve to create a wind glider that did not require the Anemo Archon's blessing — yes, it would fly by dint of its own beauty and by the physical laws that governed all things.\n\nAnd so he got to work day and night, before one day falling asleep from exhaustion. It is said that he once again encountered the Dendro Archon in his sleep.\nThe parent of living creatures listened to the great master Firnas' frustrations before laughing, and telling him a story.\n\nThe story was about the wind that had taken on a human form, a talking stone, and... Uh, a wooden thing made of Electro. The three of them discussed the makeup of the world, and each believed that they were one of the fundamental elements. The stone claimed to hold up all things, and to this they all agreed. The wooden object said that all mortal thought was the work of electricity. This was a bit of a stretch, they all reckoned, but it could not be said to be false, either. When it was the wind's turn, he told a story:\n\nThe tales of another world speak of children of the air who dwelt in the skies. These were all spirits of the wind. Some of them could slice through mountains and rocks, and others could summon tornadoes to move clouds and water with incomparable force. But the youngest of those children was disregarded by people for the weakness of his breath of life. Thus did he hide himself away. The wind-pollinated flowers were in agony, for there were none to pollinate them, and so did the boldest dandelion search for and find the breath of life. And to encourage him, the dandelion told a story:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a faraway land, there dwelt a powerful and beautiful queen, who seemed almost to shine like the sun. But her younger brother was a rambunctious, playful knight... (some omissions...) To encourage her, the queen's lady-in-waiting told her a story:\n\n...\n\nAfter that night, the great master Firnas constructed a wind glider before asking the Anemo Archon to bless it. Though it produced the exact same results as any wind glider heretofore invented, the Akademiya pronounced this similarity to be a coincidence.\nLegend has it that the first thing this great master said upon waking was: \"Alright, I know, I know! The answer was right before me this whole time.\"\nBut in truth, these were his words: \"Okay, alright, I know! The answer was right before me this whole time. Please, I beg you, stop repeating yourself — I know the gods' blessings are also part of this world's rules.\"\n\nThis fable teaches us that the truths of this world are to be honored, but that it is best not to seek physics in fantastical dreams.\nSo, how about it, then?

I may as well tell them that these wings fell from the sky as the feast began!\"\nBut though she said that, Lord Sangemah Bay still dutifully told you this story, which she herself had heard from her supplier."},{"id":"Wings140012","title":"Wings140012","filename":"Wings140012_EN.txt","text":"Legend has it that the first of oceans had a composition similar to that of blood, and that life within it was not individual. To set foot upon land or take to the skies, life evolved blood vessels to keep that primordial ocean flowing within itself. The beating heart that commanded this primordial sea of blood was the first Hydro Dragon. Each time that heart pulsed, all life would arise and give it praise.\nOf course, these are simply tales that the Hydro Vishaps tell each other, and are not to be trusted. Perhaps this tale is told differently amongst other vishaps, and the stories passed down between Oceanids speak of what came after:\n\nWhen that first heart was removed, the envoy of Celestia, the leader upon whose shoulders lay the duty to create life, came to the great primeval sea, and there she created another heart. That heart had like nobility unto a dragon, but lacked its outer form, and had the majesty of a god, yet was bereft any divine duty. And though it was created by a ruler of humans, its substance and essence were all original matter from this world, entirely without outside elements.\nShe was the tears that flowed into the primordial sea, seeking communication and understanding, a pursuit which caused her to weep. And it was due to this compassion that she committed all the sins that all beings of pure water must beware.\n\nWhat follows after that is the version of the tale that humans tell, although it is commonly passed on only amongst scholars:\nThe great Remus came to Fontaine, envisioning a mighty and eternal city, Remuria. He instructed the people, and eventually managed to reach one part of his dream. Then swiftly came the prophecy — not ill-intended, yet horrifying beyond measure — that the golden melody would one day end, and Remuria would fall.\nIt is often said that \"should a hero not die upon returning home, they shall become a tyrant.\" The justice that Remuria imposed to escape this destiny would eventually turn into tyranny, and this tyranny brought about resistance like a wrathful tide. Thus did Remus vanish — Remus the eminent, Remus the halfwit, Remus the far-sighted, Remus the solitary.\n\n...\n\nHumans desire judgment because they feel guilty. Humans desire, and so they want to receive — humans always desire a god. That is why the primordial sea's heart, gentle Egeria, was awarded a shard of that one who was first, and gained both godhood and the divine duty-come-lately. Was this the desires of humanity having reached the heavens? Or was it merely the opening act of a string of dark plots?\n\nThis is a tale that no one can know but you. When you awake, these wings, and the aforementioned tale, will appear at your bedside. You can ask all the species in this world to prove if their tales are true or not, and not one of them shall believe you, for how could this wind glider and this tale materialize before you out of thin air?"},{"id":"Wings140013","title":"Wings140013","filename":"Wings140013_EN.txt","text":"This is a small story about a song named \"A Mayfly's Dream.\"\nIt is no great or elegant song, though it was once widely praised for its melody.\nYet, new music is birthed, and old tunes gradually lose traction, and are forgotten — that is the way \"popularity\" works.\nEventually, even the name of the one who wrote this tune was no longer remembered.\nAll said that this person's talent was as short-lived as a flower, just one amongst many such composers.\n\n\"Talent as short-lived as a flower, just one amongst many such composers...\"\nWhen she had quoted this statement of public opinion, she had been looking at her older sister, who was sitting alone in the long corridor beside the courtyard.\nHer sister's back faced her, and in her hands she held a zither obliquely, plucking its strings a few times, and then a few times more.\n\"People also say that mayflies are extravagant to wish to immerse themselves in dreams despite living short lives.\"\nHer memories always had her sister's back to her, and her sister never responded to those words she said. Instead, she would always play that melody, that song that was being forgotten by the world.\nComposers do tend to like their own tunes, after all.\nHer sister would rarely have time for such things afterward. And later on... She would forever lose the opportunity to hear her sister play that song.\nAlas, she was not as interested in this field as her sister had been, and so she too gradually forgot these things.\n\nThe next time she heard that tune, it was when she was taking shelter from the rain while on traveling in private.\nThe blind zither player played this tune as a way of asking the owner for a drink. The old musician's skills were nothing exceptional, but they were up to the task.\nWhen the tune was finished, and the proffered wine was consumed, the slightly-inebriated musician waxed lyrical, claiming that the one who composed this tune had been a person of unparalleled nobility.\nOf course, these words were just rumors spread by wild-wandering folk — who would believe them?\nAmidst the laughter in the room, she alone suddenly remembered.\nShe saw again that courtyard into which the afternoon sunlight poured, saw again the breeze whose breath caused the pond to ripple, saw the tree-shade swaying slightly, and the plucking, the plucking of those strings...\nAnd she saw again, after so long, the silhouette, zither in hand, sitting beside the corridor.\nThat figure was about to turn, yes, to turn her face this way...\n\nIs being a mayfly so wrong? All things are born and die in a blink of an eye, yet their dreams burn no less for it.\nIs being a flower a sin?

I fear that it is of little use to me, so I shall give it to you.\"\nSo says the lady, even as the old zither in her hands basks in its fresh coat of paint. That said, you can tell from her stance that she is quite out of practice.\nSeeming to sense your expectant gaze, she sighs gently.\n\"Before we begin, I must caution you — my musical skills are far overshadowed by my martial ones.\"\nAnd reminiscing on the past, she begins to play the only song she ever learned."},{"id":"Wings140014","title":"Wings140014","filename":"Wings140014_EN.txt","text":"\nThis is a story set in an interstellar travel hub, where passing travelers may find a moment's respite within the small shop of an elderly adventurer. The aged shopkeeper, tired of a long wandering captaincy amidst the stars, boldly set sail to where no one had gone before, before transforming his rusty spaceship into a restaurant for travelers to rest their feet in.\n\nThe first customer was a deity who had been drifting around since her home planet was destroyed. She spoke to the shopkeeper about the fickle nature of the cosmos, as well as her affection for the life on her former planet.\n\"I remember every glorious moment of civilization's brilliance.

After you've finished eating, why don't you give it a try?\"\nThis deity was actually an artificial intelligence, created by the intelligent species of the planet to optimize resource allocation on a planetary level. The shopkeeper was right — there was still one thing she could do.\n\nThe second customer was a demon who had destroyed many worlds. After entering, it ordered a huge amount of food — so much, in fact, that the shopkeeper couldn't help but ask:\n\"You sure you can finish all that?\"\n\"Enough of your prattling! If I can't finish it, I'll just take the rest away in a little doggy bag!\" replied the demon, licking its lips. In truth, this act of licking was more akin to a snake flicking its tongue, and was the demon's way of sensing its surroundings.\nMunching away at the lovely meal it had been served, the demon boasted to the captain-turned-shopkeeper of its achievements. But in the end, it couldn't finish it all.\n\"Why didn't you finish it? Was it not to your liking?\"\nThe demon had never, not once before, been questioned like this. For a brief moment, it wanted to lie and say, \"It was horrible.\" But upon seeing that legendary captain start going for his flintlock, it chose to stay on its best behavior and asked him to help wrap up the leftovers instead.\nIt may not have known at the time, but the demon had just saved its own life. Back when the adventurer had been given the title of \"honorary first mate,\" he had also been granted authorization to execute troublemakers in his shop.

The celebratory clamor had little to do with him, and indeed, he would have to help clean up the flowers, both real and fake, strewn about after the fact.

Some say the practice dates back to an age when the true moon hung in the sky, and perhaps the beings who gathered beneath it were not fae at all. In any case, gazing at the moon and speaking of times old and new is considered by the boldest among them to be the perfect moment for sharing secrets.\nAnd among all the tales they tell, there is one they love the most:\n\nAccording to legend, the king of the Fae of the Snowlands — a hero born from the bones of a great beast — sought to unite the entire continent. To do so, he had to slay his final enemy.\nYet that enemy could neither age nor die, for his life was hidden far from his body. No matter how many times the king of the snowy realms struck him down, he would rise again from the shadows.\nSo, the spirit of frost and a traveler from beyond the palace walls set out to seek the truth of this foe. At last, they learned how he might be killed.\nTo kill the enemy, the Snow-King would need to find a fissure buried deep in the earth's darkest strata. Within that crack lay a tree that grew downward. Upon the tree's tower-like branches perched a raven. Within the raven's belly lay a snow-white hare. In the hare's eyes was a door. And if he opened that door, a world as black as spilled ink would pour forth, swallowing both heaven and earth. In that world, everything was still. There was no light, and no sound. The Snow-King would have to cross that silent realm alone and, at its lightless heart, find an egg.\nThis egg held the essence of his enemy's life. Shatter it, and the immortal enemy would be reduced to dust.\nThe task did not seem too difficult up to the moment of opening the door, or so the snow-realm's king thought. But how was he going to cross that realm of pitch-black silence?\nSo, the spirit of frost and the traveler wove two wings of ancient moonlight for him.\n\nThis, then, may have been the wind glider that could carry one through the silent void. Yet the old moonlight has long since lost its radiance, and the snow-realm king who once used them has vanished from history. What remains today functions no better than an ordinary wind glider. In fact, since wind gliders were invented far later than the age of the Snow-King, this entire tale may well be a fanciful explanation someone crafted to justify the glider's existence.\n\nAnd how did the snow-realm king meet his end, you ask?\nSome say that when he shattered the egg, he finally saw the truth: His greatest enemy bore his face.\nOthers claim the egg never existed, and that the world beyond the door was nothing more than a trap meant to keep him in the void.\nThere are far too many versions to count.

Thanks to the existence of alchemy, the underground kingdom has nurtured many subterranean lifeforms that can thrive on fungi alone. As a result, meat is plentiful, yet vegetables and grains — crops that require the sun's light to grow — are in short supply. As King Irmin's rule becomes increasingly tyrannical, and relations between Khaenri'ah and the surface grow ever more strained, the price of grain, fruits, and vegetables has soared.\n\nThe ring that sits beside the flour and breadcrumbs is more valuable still.
