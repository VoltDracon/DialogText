To you, my esteemed guest who has gathered all the Proof of the Cognoscenti,

If you're reading this note, it means that you've successfully solved my puzzle. Congratulations, well done!

Now, the legendary "great treasure" you're looking for is right in front of you.

You're welcome. Please enjoy yourself. These unclaimed riches are the spoils due to the Cognoscenti.

However, as the founder of the Treasure Hoarders, I would like to give you one more piece of advice.

No matter who you are, exposing mountains of wealth to the light of day, flaunting it in pursuit of glory and vanity, thereby attracting the envy and covetous eyes of countless onlookers... It is not a wise move.

Please take these treasures, which belong to you alone, away quietly. Then, remove this note and pretend you never found anything. Let people believe that the Proof of the Cognoscenti still lies scattered across every corner of this continent, waiting to be gathered by those fortunate few chosen by fate. Let the story continue to circulate; let those who dream of sudden riches continue their hard work. This way, the wealth you've obtained after countless trials will sit much more safely in your hands.
