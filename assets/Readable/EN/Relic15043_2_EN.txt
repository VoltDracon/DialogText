Once there was an age when the silver wheels that guided the primal heavens yet remained three.
At that time, The Winged One who tread upon morning stars and dwelt high above the moon became the Lord of the Eternal Heavens.

The Ark was moored, the matter of creation complete. The mountains and rivers were wrought in their turn.
Beneath the earth and deep within the seas dwelt the fallen clans and broken kings of the Old World.
The Lord of the World within the eggshell drew a false veil to shut out the true, bedeviled skies,
Obscuring dread that once robbed kings of sleep, even those who held dominion over beasts.

The sun's fierce light swept the heavens clean, but the freshly forged throne still reserved a place in the sky for the Three Sisters of the Moonlit Night.
Perhaps by its design, even a world where the elements surge in perfect order still needed tides.
The Lectors of Thirty Nights knew that alone, they could not protect this lonely, desolate planet from the inevitable doom that approached.
Before the coming of the final extinction, no victor in the struggle of good and evil could be worse than the doom of falling together into eternal oblivion.
Perhaps their former lord, shrouded in mist, would never find the answer. Or perhaps that answer was already at hand.

As they had hoped, the great ruler of the firmament spurned the destroyer veiled in black mist.
No doubt, through its long voyage across the shadowed realms, it had witnessed countless stars meet their end.
And so, they too chose Order. Or, more accurately, made space to accommodate it.
That was the age when the three moons shared governance with the morning star. That was the age when Eternity was yet Eternity.
