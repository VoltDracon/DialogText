Alain has provided me with many notebooks. I often discard them after making a few markings. On those occasions, his expression was unreadable. Nevertheless, he supplies me with new ones. I do not understand his reasoning.
I do not know why I discarded them after making markings. I do not know why he permits this behavior. He states that my emotion module is optimal. I do not comprehend.
This is a new notebook. I do not wish to discard it.
I have learned to record.
I am beginning to record.

I have learned more, and my manner of speech has become more elegant. "Elegant" is the new word I have learned. Alain advised me not to push myself. I disagree. I have performed exceptionally well.
We conversed this afternoon. I have drawn several conclusions: 1. Alain created me. 2. He modeled me after memories of his deceased sister, and now he feels guilt. 3. My learning ability exceeds his expectations.
Alain Guillotin's younger sister was named Mary-Ann Guillotin. She passed away long ago. Alain finalized my creation on his 65th birthday. He stated that I am a friend. A family member. He expressed happiness about gaining a companion.
Alain has not defined our relationship. It is evident that I am not Mary-Ann Guillotin. He concurred, noting that I am significantly different from his sister. He expressed a desire for me to act according to my own will.
When I stated that I would no longer discard the notebooks, Alain's composure wavered briefly. He likely experienced an urge to "weep," but ultimately suppressed it.
Alain said I could choose a birthday if I wished. I will consider this proposal seriously. He mentioned that most people cannot choose their birth date, but I can. I am free.

Alain's physical condition continues to deteriorate. Doctors have visited frequently. Each time, he closes the door. I am excluded from the process.
I sensed something unfamiliar. Later, Alain identified the sensations as "anger" and "sadness." He expressed satisfaction that I was learning to recognize them.
However, he noted that I do not yet understand "guilt." He explained that the social mechanisms behind this emotion are too complex for most animals or machines to acquire easily.
I have concluded that understanding "guilt" is not a necessary function for me.
Alain inquired about my desires. My response was, "I want you to be healthy."
Also, Alain presented a new invention to me. He has named it "Pulonia."
I cannot classify Pulonia as family, kin, or friend. Its architecture lacks an emotion module comparable to mine.
The reason for Alain's design choice to create it with different specifications is unclear to me. He asserted that both Pulonia and I are unique and cannot be replicated. He clarified that I am myself, whereas Pulonia is a purely mechanical construct.
