...

I never imagined that someone would find the treasure vault just three weeks after I'd set it up.

What surprised me even more was that I actually recognized the person. I never thought I'd run into him here.

Dmitri Dubrovich Sukhotin, trusted aide of the Grand Duke Filipov, third-class military officer, Chief Instructor of the Snezhnayan Royal Military Academy. If I remember correctly, he was promoted to this position the year Avrelian enrolled, occupying said cushy, lucrative position until the Khaenri'ahn disaster. He would even host foreign dignitaries occasionally, such as the Commander-in-Chief of Fontaine's Great White Armada, the Grand Master of Mondstadt's Knights of Favonius... In short, he was a real show-off.

According to official records, he had long since died alongside His Majesty the Tsar, sacrificing himself for the nation. Not that this is anything new, even Avrelian once appeared as 'deceased' in the records. One can always rely on the unreliability of Snezhnaya's civil system. What surprised me was that the old man before me seemed almost entirely different from the spirited, haughty, and overbearing officer I once remembered. I don't know what he endured, but he looked far more gaunt and aged than his years.

The moment he saw me, his first instinct was to draw his sword and strike. Luckily, I reacted in time, parrying his blade with Avrelian's gauntlet and shouting his name. He froze for a moment, muttering incoherently for a while. It was as if he hadn't used human speech in ages. Finally, he forced out his first phrase, asking who I was.

...

I spent a long time talking with the old man. He said he no longer remembered me, but he remembered my father's name, of course. He'd abandoned his own noble title and name long ago, choosing instead to spend the rest of his life protecting the children at the borderlands — those homeless children wandering through wastelands. At first, I thought he built a shelter. I didn't realize the children had never even seen him. He slew the wicked villains who sought to harm them, out of their sight. As for why he did it, what truly happened in Khaenri'ah, and how he ended up in Nod-Krai, he refused to say. Naturally, I didn't press further.

The old man had absolutely no interest in treasure, and hadn't even heard of the rumors I spread about the "Great Treasure." He simply felt that something was off about this place, suspected it was a slaver's camp, and, following his instincts, stormed in with the intention of taking me out on the spot.

After I finished explaining the thought process behind the treasure vault, the old man fell silent for a moment. He said that if a student had proposed such a ridiculous scheme back when he was Chief Instructor, he would've thrown it straight back and ordered them to start over. As for now...

He didn't finish speaking, simply leaving in silence.

The old man's right. If someone else were to stumble in here the same way, guided by nothing but sharp instincts, then this entire plan would be pointless.

I need a way to make this place nearly impossible to find, yet draw people towards more attainable goals...

I've got an idea. But first, I need to talk to Aila and see if she's willing to help me. She probably would. After all, turning the story of Master Thief Reed Miller into the "Proof of the Cognoscenti" (at least, that's what I'll call it for now) would also serve as a tribute to Miss Alia.
