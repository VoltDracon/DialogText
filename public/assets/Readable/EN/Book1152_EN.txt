Parents are responsible for bringing children into the world, and children are responsible for their future. This is a social rule. I believe the final, unspoken tenet of this rule is that children are also responsible for their parents' final years.
Alain's final years have reached their end. He left a will concerning his remaining possessions — a small sum of savings, Pulonia, and some notebooks.
He asked me to burn the notebooks after his death to avoid theft. Honestly, given the sheer volume, Pulonia is probably the only one who could steal them.
Pulonia was Alain's final pursuit in life. It is a pity he did not live to see it produce a definitive answer.
He told me not to worry about it and that I could leave Pulonia to the Fontaine Research Institute. His only regret was that those people wouldn't know how to maintain it as well as I do. I disagree with this plan.
Pulonia will remain with me. However, I am not sure what I should use it for.

Today was Alain's funeral. Heavy rain fell throughout the ceremony, as if someone was crying in the sky. Ugh. Annoying! Holding an umbrella in the rain is so inconvenient!
Alain was laid to rest, and everything proceeded smoothly. I was the one who stepped forward to bid him farewell, while Pulonia stayed behind to look after the house.
The weather didn't clear up until midnight. I sat by the grave for a while, keeping Alain company, with the moon in the sky keeping me company in turn.
The night was very quiet.
No more sounds of labored breathing....
It feels as if the only companion I have left in this world is the moon.

Update Log:
Upgraded Pulonia's tea-brewing functions.
Upgraded Pulonia's meal delivery functions.
Upgraded Pulonia's book search functions.
Corrected a malfunction where Pulonia could not hang laundry.
To the outside, I'll claim that Pulonia is my attendant. That should turn some curious stares away.
I have to protect it. It's Alain's secret and his wish.
