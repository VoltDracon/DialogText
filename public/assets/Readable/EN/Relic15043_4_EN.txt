Once there was an age when the silver wheels that guided the primal heavens yet remained three.
At that time, the laws bestowed from the heavens had yet to be assembled, and the boundaries of humanity had yet to be defined.

The sons and daughters of the gods were scattered across the newly-wrought gardens and valleys, their number countless.
The envoys of the sky walked among benighted human crowds then, sowing prosperity and wisdom.
In the end, the prosperity promised by the gods kindled the flame of intellect, which in turn stirred the whispers of doubt.

In quest of the answer, the people chose their priests; in fear of the answer, the priests anointed their kings.
Mortal folly stirred the ire of the gods' envoys. Faced with their questions, the divine envoys uttered no word.
And so the people turned their gazes toward the sky, offering sacrifices to the three bright moons in the dark, sunless night.

Above the night sky, the daughters of dreams and poetry kept vigilant, unceasing watch over the mortal world's every change.
In the deep slumber of the Arianrhod Realm, at the foot of the seventy-tiered staircase, beside the gleaming silver vessels.
Until they heard that the hearts of these pitiful little humans would also stir with the lunar quakes...

The night cast its eyes upon the earth, just as the silver stars once lit the way for the dragons' sky-faring ships.
They brought madness and inspiration back beneath the moon. It was a reply that Order could not give.
When the morning star rose again, the archpriestess returned from the mountain's summit with a small circular talisman.
This "Moon Wheel" was the new pact between the three moons and the people.
