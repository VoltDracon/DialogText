Alain has passed out. His condition is deteriorating.
The doctor examined him with a grim expression.
Alain's subordinate came to visit him, bringing a brand-new tea set and some expensive tea leaves. Alain doesn't like to drink tea, nor is he used to using luxurious things. So the tea set is mine.

All my potted plants are thriving. This is simple, and it seems almost too straightforward to claim any credit for myself. When conditions are right, they simply grow on their own, independent of any gardener.
I see a parallel in myself. I, too, don't rely on anything to grow.

Today, I helped Alain with Pulonia's final tests. He's been unable to walk, so I transported him there in his wheelchair.
Alain displayed little emotion. Despite Pulonia's stable performance, he wasn't satisfied.
He explained that Pulonia is, in essence, merely an algorithm designed to calculate the unknown. As for what "the unknown" is, he himself is uncertain.
The scope of the "unknown" is vast, too vast to quantify. I find it difficult to process that even he lacks an answer, and that this realization causes him sorrow.
I don't understand.
Alain asked: "How shall we view the fate of this world?" "Use a detector," I responded.

Alain has entrusted me with his old notebooks. It brings me genuine joy, and I find great value in the knowledge he imparted.
Lately, I've been contemplating the fate of this world. I quickly concluded that it is an inquiry without an answer. If people cannot even grasp their own destinies, how can they presume to meddle with the world's? A truly foolish notion.
Alain remarked that there are quite a few fools who hold such ideas. I laughed and gave him a disbelieving look. Then, he began to laugh as well, though I cannot comprehend what he finds amusing.
