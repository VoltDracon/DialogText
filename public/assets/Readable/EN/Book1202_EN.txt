...My heart's beloved, how delightful your expressions were to my inmost self! How have they been cut away by the shears of some unyielding false authority, leaving my innermost being a wasteland?

...Had it not been for the wild wolf that intruded upon my dwelling, your name too would've faded entirely from my recollection.

...O false master, I once devoted my voice to singing for you, and once I vanquished nations at your behest. Yet, you cast me down to be trod upon like a lifeless corpse upon the earth.

...You have rendered the earth a desolation, overturning its cities, preventing monarchs from entering their final repose. You have laid waste their kingdoms, slaughtered their people, and spared neither offspring nor posterity.

...I shall never best you. You have triumphed and shall triumph still. Can clay ever conquer the very potter who shaped it?

...Your blade falls upon the proud heads of the people, intoxicating the earth with blood, drowning the lofty mountains and all the pines that adorn them.

...Yet, I can still await the one my heart loves. The starlight will guide my return to that great city, where I will await our promised reunion.

...May the lambs of your flock remain loyal to you. May they yield your sacred commands, may they obey your decrees, most worthy of obedience.

...I will return to my own lands and wait for the star beyond the stars, the one who holds my liberty in thrall. To sing in the nothingness of utter ruin is far more agreeable than to endure servitude beneath a false heavenly light.

...You whom my heart loves, you built this pale edifice for me, yet I am about to defy your edict and return to the lands whence we came from, which exist no more. I shall await the day freedom dawns upon you, just as you once so generously bestowed it upon me.

...No matter how many years may pass, or if the morning star should fade...
