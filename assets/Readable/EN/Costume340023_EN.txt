It had journeyed through countless worlds and endless distances, surveying every kind of terrain and gazing upon skies tinted in different colors.
This might sound romantic, but in reality, the matter was closer to torture than adventure.
It also once pictured a scene like this: Twins standing under the radiant night sky, their eyes shining as they watched the stars and the many moons above.
But it immediately disconnected its idea association module. A sky with such colors only meant that the atmosphere was unfit for life. After witnessing such vistas hundreds of times, there was no longer any need to be moved by them.
It did not wake the slumbering twin travelers. Instead, it carried the weight of an exile and a journey so long that numbers had lost their meaning.

The fine details of the lithosphere, atmosphere, or biosphere ultimately mattered little.
Reshaping terrain, adjusting the air, rebuilding an ecosystem, these were simple tasks for a pioneer vessel meant to bear the spark of civilization.
A star's position, its distance, or its lifespan might pose a minor challenge, yet even those had solutions.

The true difficulty lay in finding a world with potential. Without that, destruction would catch up all too soon.

It was a trivial matter in the span of a long voyage.
The planet they passed was never a destination, since its star had already entered its twilight.
Its biosphere and atmosphere had been utterly destroyed. The surface held nothing but cooled masses of molten rock.
A supernova had caused the devastation.

For several weeks or months, intense heat and light had marked the star's final brilliance. After that, it had been reduced to a cold, dim dwarf.
It ran a quick calculation on when the event had occurred...
What a coincidence. The radiation trapped in the planet's crust indicated that the supernova had erupted the very year the twins were born.
Naturally, the two events had nothing to do with each other.
No one would ever celebrate their birth by burying an entire world with it. Such levels of extravagance and cruelty simply did not exist.

Interstellar travel was dangerous, after all. A supernova five or six light-years away could damage the genetic vault, and perhaps the twins as well.
It immediately modified the garments in the wardrobe, upgrading them with materials better suited for interstellar travel, and laid them over the stasis pods. The gesture might not amount to much, but it offered a quiet kind of comfort.

Within their slumber, the twins were granted new refuge, and so, it continued its journey across countless lands and stones, numberless atmospheres and skies.
