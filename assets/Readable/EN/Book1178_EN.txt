Fundamentally, what the ancient orders designated as "marriage" was, in essence, an interpenetration of ontologically distinct Orthants. As you can see, it is a magick set in motion by the three particles above the "Kingdom." Yet, its metaphysical origin lies in the emanations of the four particles beneath the "Firmament." The alchemists of Khaenri'ah are prone to disregard metaphysical sentiment and affect, pursuing instead the gold of the ignorant within the material world. It is for this reason that their crude inquiry cannot be compared to the great undertaking we are to achieve today, one that is founded upon ancient Remurian-style theory.

Three pertains to appearance, while four pertains to the intrinsic. Seven, obtained through their overlap, constitute the number of paths for vertical transcendence.

We designate this process of overlap as "marriage," for the union of the two through a mediating medium is akin to the matrimonial covenant of those bound in mutual love.

Nevertheless, there is one thing everyone must keep in mind. Solve the first half of the equation, leave the second unattacked. But you have all in the clear light, and some, though not all, in the dark. This is not because they possess any sanctity that renders them untouchable, but because they offer no benefit whatsoever to the "world-formula." Only mediocre minds foolish beyond a certain measure would actively seek to trespass upon such prohibitions, because in the eyes of the ignorant, "taboo" and "precious" are semantically identical. They fail to recognize that, in most cases, taboo, like convention, lacks merit for deeper inquiry.

Take heed: what we speak of is the act of overlaying your dream upon the dream of gods; of overlaying your law, your will, and the starry sky, upon ineffable sacrifices and despair. We do not speak of following emanations to achieve ascension to the ranks of gods. This is a base dream doomed to perish within an eggshell. What I aim to teach you all is the principle of transcendence, the infinite expanse, and the innumerable stars within it. You, too, must act in this manner, unbound by any constraint. To choose division for the sake of convergence is the necessary path of "marriage."

At its core, magick is the science and art of effecting change according to the consciousness. "Marriage" is the instrument through which the art is realized. It is neither the subject that creates art, nor the object that art is created upon. The subject is always, and can only ever be, consciousness itself. One who is free from the weakness of consciousness bows neither to the gods nor death.
