I bought new bedsheets, pillowcases, and curtains.
My room is now refreshingly tidy. I must say, that was a clever decision!

I've been too modest in my recent records. I'm not just smart, I'm brilliant.
I am a quick learner. Even Alain agrees.

Alain's body won't hold on much longer. He sat by the fireplace and told me some stories.
He created me, in the beginning, to honor the memory of the years he spent with his sister. He hadn't even decided what to do with me when he first brought me into being. Later, he hoped I could travel on his behalf, to see the world and broaden my own horizons.
One problem. Alain and I are now colleagues, both tied down by long-term professional commitments! It seems true freedom to travel is for those unburdened by work. As he put it, that dream lies in ruins now. A complete and utter failure.
He mentioned that he once had another wish, but abandoned it long ago. I pressed him for details, and he admitted, with some awkwardness, that he once dreamed of saving the world when he was young...
I asked if this was a wish I needed to inherit. He was taken aback and firmly told me no. He said I can do anything I like, and that he has no expectations of me.
Alain asked if there was anything I wanted to do. Well, I... haven't found that yet.
