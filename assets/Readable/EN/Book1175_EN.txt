...About the Golden Troupe...
...Comparative studies have been conducted on the surviving ruins of ancient orders from across the land... While they all had different names, the scripts and images left behind support the conclusion that they share the same origin... Ancient scholars believed that all arcane arts originated from a pre-Remurian civilization, a belief that now seems to be much more than mere speculation...

..."Fortuna"... seems to be the name of a symphony... Remurian musicians call it the "Musica Mundana" or "the music of origin." In their eyes, the rise and fall of civilizations, as well as the fates of mortals, are all orchestrated by the movements of a symphony. And when a civilization perishes, a new one is always born in its wake...

...Their philosophical system is complex and enigmatic, bearing almost no relation to modern Fontaine's natural philosophy... However, this is hardly surprising. According to historical records, after Remuria was brought to ruins, the refugees fell under the Lochknight Erinnyes's sway. They willingly forsook their ancient faiths, tongues, and writings, embracing a life of devotion to the gods as our forebears once had...

...I hinted at the matter to the Golden Hunter in an oblique way (since the Marechaussee Hunters who first pledged themselves to his cause were all descendants of the Lochknights, praising the benevolence of Erinnyes seemed like the safest approach), and inquired about his knowledge of natural philosophy from that era... He was silent for about half a minute, then told me not to probe too deeply into those ancient philosophies, saying there was a reason they had been forgotten...

...Still, as a gesture of gratitude, the Golden Hunter was willing to tell me the names of these patterns...

...The "Seal of Chymical Marriage"... According to him, this symbol is even older than the Remurian civilization itself, and was one of the gifts bestowed upon King Remus by the Golden Bee (what exactly those were remains unclear)...

...The rise and fall of empires and civilizations, the ascension of mortals and the emanation of light (what is this?), even dreams of surpassing the gods (what is this?) — all of these can be represented by this formula... I cannot understand it at all. He declined to elaborate, and so I can only record these matters here, as they were told to me, in the hope that those who come after might one day decipher their meaning...
