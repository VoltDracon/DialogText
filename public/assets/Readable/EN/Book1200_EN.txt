...

...My body rests in sleep, yet my heart wakes.

...I see mist rising from the ground all around, accompanied by an elegant, mournful sound. It's the music of lyres and lutes.

...My heart has never known this voice, my eyes have never seen this temple.

...This temple was constructed from stones of substantial size. Someone made pillars from these stones and sheathed them in gold. They also cast golden sockets to lift the golden beams and rafters.

...I can't see light in the sky. No sun shines, no moon walks, but the light in this temple is very strong, like a pale and bright star of morning.

...Yet my heart remains empty. I cannot forget my sorrow nor rid myself of my anguish to bring ease to my heart. I have even forgotten my name and my past. They abandon me like water that has flowed by.

...How should I reminisce about the past? Why does it act like the morning mist, the dew that vanishes in an instant? Why is it like chaff blown away by the wind, the smoke rising outside the window?

...Only one thing is engraved on my heart like a seal, keeping me ever vigilant. There is a voice that says to me, "You must wait here. You cannot cross the threshold of this temple, nor can you go outside."

...This seal is steadfast. I know not whose instruction it is. I dare not leave.

...

...There are many tiny spirits walking around me. Their forms are incomplete, yet they emit a desolate light.

...I look at them and find that I do not recognize them. Yet, my heartstrings wail like a lyre.

...My heart is troubled within me; my spirit is distressed within me. My innermost being is utterly desolate, like a ruined city, like a woman stripped of her crown.

...My heart, what is it that causes you such melancholy? What causes this vexation within me?

...I cannot remain silent. I will play this lyre with my hands and sing songs to clear the pain so that my heart may be at ease. I will not dwell on my name or my deeds; I will let them flow by like water.

...The song flows from my lips, flying away like a dream, never to be found again. Like a river of living water, it springs forth without my prior contemplation. It's as if I have always known it.

...Though I sing, my heart is filled with sorrow. My tears flow like a river, yet I know not for whom I mourn. So, I sing.

...I weep day and night, tears drenching my cheeks. I commemorate what cannot be commemorated, I recall what cannot be recalled. Yet, no one sees my loneliness or pain. So, I sing.

...This sorrow overwhelms my life, yet I cannot overcome it. So, I sing.
