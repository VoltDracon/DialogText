Rumors about "Proof of the Cognoscenti" have been spread.

Once people know that a key exists, they won't go out of their way to find alternative means of entry. All I have to do now is fabricate a few tales of treasure hunters who tried to take shortcuts but came up empty-handed, then spread them under the names of "Brahe the Bard" and "Grand Duke Trubetskoy." That should be more than enough to convince future generations of the necessity of seeking the Proof of the Cognoscenti.

"Like his greedy father, the new Grand Duke Trubetskoy heard rumors of the treasure and schemed to seize even the gifts the Master Thief had left for the poor..."

"And what magnificent treasure it was! More splendid than the gold of Hiisi, more dazzling than the silver of Kitezhgrad... Even the flesh and blood of the Lord of Geo could scarcely measure its worth..."

"Such was the vast hoard of Iron Coins that the Master Thief left behind, wealth enough to shake the very economy of the northern lands..."

Wait, that's not right. If I were to list the treasure's contents outright, some people would lose interest.

"Such was the treasure that the Master Thief left behind, wealth enough to shake the very economy of the northern lands; even a bard with such nimble lips and silver tongue as I could scarcely recount it in full..."

Alright, that'll do! And lastly, I'll spin something about how the new Grand Duke Trubetskoy was effortlessly bested by the Master Thief's companion, a beauty known as "Wagtail." As long as it's written in a sufficiently dashing manner, I'm sure Miss Alia wouldn't mind.
