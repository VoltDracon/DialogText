...I have sat alone in this temple for many days. Those who passed by cannot see me. I've been desolate and faint all day, sighing over the afflictions and hardships of this land, but only the tiny spirits mourned with me.

...I still cannot reminisce about the past, but my heart is slightly comforted. My song falls like dew, descending like gentle rain upon tender grass, like a timely monsoon nourishing crops, making my words flow more smoothly.

...Those who pass by never enter this vast forest, and those who come from foreign lands never see this pale temple.

...

...When brambles and thorned plants sprouted from the ground, a wild beast invaded my dwelling.

...Storms came from the south, cold came from the north. That beast came from the north, bearing the chill of ice and snow.

...Its mouth uttered no human speech, but it gazed upon me as upon heavenly light, and longed for my song as a thirsty servant longed for spring rain.

...Since I had a beast to keep me company, serving as my emissary, how could I possibly mourn?

...Sing to it I shall. Just as I shall also mock and ridicule its foolish ways.

...Yet, it did not grow impatient or resentful. Instead, it listened carefully to my words and heeded my voice. It bowed low before me, obeying my commands and decrees.

...I called it a stupid dog, but it bore no grudge. I patted its fur, but it showed no anger.

...I found it pleasing to the eye and rather endearing, so I named it Boreas (meaning "North Wind") and let it, as well as its kin, share my dwelling.

...

...We sat in this temple for many days. Astonishingly, human words would come from its mouth. A beast that had been utterly foolish and ignorant would possess wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge. It could treat others with kindness and sincerity.

...It spoke to me and called me Mother. It said, "I will go to the South, where the people are poor and lowly, yet the cities are large and fortified. I will make them prosperous."

...I granted its request, and it departed with its kin. I called its name one last time, bidding it farewell.

...Boreas... Boreas... Borea...

...I remember...
