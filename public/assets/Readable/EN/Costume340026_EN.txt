Upon his arrival in Fontaine, Neuvillette, with utmost care, selected a place to stay within the Palais Mermonia.
He fancied not quarters that scraped the heavens, for they stole him away from the water's gentle surface. Yet, dwelling too low vexed him, as his gaze yearned for the ocean some distance away, a view that brought peace to his heart.
And so, he picked a place betwixt and between, laying his few private possessions there. In this world of humans, where he was neither master nor thrall, claiming a room of his own seemed to be the first grand choice he'd ever made.
He once believed the need for such contemplations would not come around again until the Melusines gradually joined the Marechaussee Phantom. Their human comrades, who lived far from the Court of Fontaine, could choose to live in staff dormitories provided by the Palais Mermonia. Melusines working here enjoyed the same rights.
Acting out of a protective nature, Neuvillette naturally wished for the Melusines to dwell on a floor adjacent to his own. If they reside just one story above, he could easily trace their comings and goings by the gentle patter of their feet upon the stairs.
But then, quick as a wink, a thought bloomed in his mind. Perhaps the Melusines might not wish for such scrutiny. Moreover, some of the cases he'd handled reminded him that kindness, when piled too high, could brew a cauldron of woes.
In the end, he decided to let the Melusines choose for themselves, just as he had done upon first arriving in the Court of Fontaine.
The Melusines, with hearts full of joy, picked a floor beneath his. "It's but a skip and a hop from where Monsieur Neuvillette and our human colleagues live. Should the alarms ring, we can answer them with even greater speed. How very convenient!"
As time spun on, fortunes both glimmering and grim did befall. Deep within his heart, in a place untouched by knowing, perhaps he chided himself for deeds beyond his grasp.

As the Dragon of Water, he had always believed that he bore a certain responsibility for this primordial world. And as this world slowly unfolded before him, and he finally accepted the place he now occupied, that sense of responsibility ceased to be a grand, abstract ideal, becoming instead a series of very real duties that needed to be fulfilled.
Or, to put it more bluntly: born in this manner, however unwilling he might have been to admit it, he was bound to enter the present age — and, in time, feel the stirrings of a desire to do something within it.
Like now, for example, Neuvillette thinks, having already taken the Melusines and Pahsiv under his care, "to fulfill their wishes" ought to be written into his memorandum — and, while there is still time, treated with the utmost seriousness indeed.
With that in mind, he changed into his new clothes. As he walked out of his office, his footsteps rang with certainty.
However, the events that followed soon drifted beyond his control once more. By pure chance, he ran into Sigewinne and Wriothesley, and as he wandered along with the two of them, talking about this and that, he found himself in unforeseen places, acquiring unexpected things.
He could not help but wonder whether such a tale of his travels, told upon his return to the Melusines and Pahsiv, would delight them. Neuvillette found himself anxious, fearing that a journey taken so freely and without plan might lack order — and that, in doing so, he might fail to live up to their kindness.
"...Say, Head Nurse, have you ever felt that being overly responsible can, at times, be a kind of 'arrogance'?" Thus spoke Wriothesley, while Neuvillette was lost in his own thoughts. Perhaps he was reading too much into it, but when the Duke addressed Sigewinne, he seemed to throw a glance in his direction.
Neuvillette was startled. That was exactly the sort of person he was. Mere praise left him unbothered, for to him they were nothing more than a part of polite human interaction. But a "critical" remark like this would send him into a flurry, making him wonder whether he had once again done something odd — soaking himself to the bone in a downpour came to mind.
"Then I think you can afford to be a bit more 'arrogant,' Your Grace, instead of neglecting your work for an entire month," Sigewinne said, clearly dissatisfied. "And perhaps you could take a lesson or two from the Duke's 'modesty,' Monsieur Neuvillette... Ah, another fork in the road."
Sigewinne turns to a silent Neuvillette, her face lighting up with a smile. "Monsieur Neuvillette, which path should we take?"
"Indeed." Perhaps pleased by the change of topic, or perhaps with a hint of meaning behind it, Wriothesley also turned to him. "Quick, Neuvillette, you have three seconds. Which way do you want to go?"
Neuvillette stared down the plain, unremarkable fork in the road, as if transported back to countless moments when he had to make a choice. Yet this time, there was not a trace of heaviness in his heart. Perhaps it was the gentle night breeze of this foreign land that made the word "responsibility" feel suddenly distant. It had nothing to do with his ancient identity, nothing to do with the expectations of others, and nothing to do with factors beyond his control. Perhaps some things were simply that simple, and he only had to consider what he truly "wanted."
"Let's take the path with more people on it."
...Of course, some simple responsibilities couldn't be set aside.
"But if there's no shop selling Xiao Lanterns along this path, we'll have to come all the way back to find one. I did make the Melusines a promise, after all."
"Alright, sure."
